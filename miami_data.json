WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved Zoning Z-18-17 Mover: Esteban L. Bovo, Jr. Seconder: Xavier L. Suarez Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Barreiro , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read the title of the item into the record. Mr. Hugo Arser (phonetic spelling), 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, attorney representing Manor Lakes, appeared before the Board, noting the Application enjoyed the approval of the Countyï¿½s Zoning Department, and the communityï¿½s support.  He said the applicant was asking for a modest increase in the number of students, buildings and parking spaces for a Charter School that had been in the community for nearly 10 years. Chairman Bovo called the names on the speakersï¿½ cards into the record, and verified that the speakers were in support of the Application. Chairman Bovo relinquished the Chair. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve staffï¿½s recommendation with conditions. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-18-17. Chairman Bovo resumed the Chair. B 171845 Zoning HEARING NO. 16-102  --  DISTRICT(S) 02  --  SAFEGUARD FL 1, LLC  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO AMEND THE LAND USE REGULATING PLAN OF THE NORTH CENTRAL URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (NCUAD) BY CHANGING THE LAND USE DESIGNATION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM MM (MIXED-USE MAIN STREET) TO MC (MIXED-USE CORRIDOR).  ADDITIONALLY, THE APPLICANT SEEKS APPROVAL OF DELETIONS FOR TWO DECLARATIONS OF RESTRICTIONS, AND APPROVAL OF NON-USE VARIANCES OF SETBACK, BUILD-TO-LINE, BUILDING FENESTRATION, AND OTHER NON-USE VARIANCES WITHIN THE NORTH CENTRAL URBAN AREA DISTRICT (NCUAD).  THE APPLICANT IS ALSO SEEKING APPROVAL OF TWO USE VARIANCES TO WAIVE SOME STREET TREES, AND SOME CURBS AND GUTTERS ON THE PROPERTY  --  LOCATION:  12000 NW 27 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA. WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved Zoning Z-19-17 Mover: Jean Monestime Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Suarez , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read the title of the item into the record. Ms. Ines Marrero (phonetic spelling), 701 Brickell Ave., Miami, attorney for the applicant, appeared before the Board, noting the Application had staffï¿½s support.  She stated that the applicant was seeking to expand an existing use; and this use provided a service to the residents. Chairman Bovo called the name on the speakerï¿½s card into the record, and verified that the speaker was in support of the Application. In response to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s request for clarification regarding how the changes would modify the covenant, Mr. Kogon clarified that the changes would not modify the covenant; rather, the old covenants which referenced the old plan would be deleted, and a new plan would be proffered. Commissioner Monestime noted his understanding that this proposed plan would not adhere to the current zoning overlay on 27th Avenue, because the parking for this development would be on the side of the building. Mr. Kogon explained that the new structure would be placed in the rear of the building, closer to older, industrial uses.  He noted the front of the lot on 27th Avenue would be available for potential re-development. Ms. Marrero provided a description of the site plan, as follows.  She noted the property was located on 27th Avenue and 120th Street; and the site plan depicted the existing building and its parking, which was approved when the property was zoned BU1A.  She explained that when the property was rezoned the use was not permitted, and this was the reason for the request to amend the land use regulating plan of the North Central Urban Center District by changing the land use designation from Mixed-Use Main Street to Mixed-Use Corridor.  Ms. Marrero further noted the applicant was proposing to build another building in the rear of the main building, which would be serviced from the front. Commissioner Monestime said he understood that there was a request to remove curbs, edges and trees; and Ms. Marrero indicated that those requests were withdrawn. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question regarding the issue with the sidewalk, Mr. Kogon explained that the existing sidewalk was 8 feet wide; and while the Code required a 9-feet width, staff deemed that 8 feet were sufficient.  He noted the existing building had an 8-foot sidewalk because it was developed prior to the 9-feet requirement; now that the applicant was re-developing the property, they would ensure that the sidewalk was 9 feet wide. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve staffï¿½s recommendation with conditions; and to withdraw Requests #9 and #10, as requested by the applicant. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-19-17. C 171846 Zoning HEARING NO. 16-246  --  DISTRICT(S) 10  --  KEEP BLEAU GREEN COMMITTEE, INC  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM GU, INTERIM DISTRICT TO RU-4L, LIMITED APARTMENT DISTRICT.

Souto Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Barreiro , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, noted the applicant had requested a deferral of this item as the plans needed further modification. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to defer the item to the Zoning meeting of September 14, 2017. APPEALS : 1 171847 Zoning HEARING NO. 16-079  --  DISTRICT(S) 11  --  ORBE SERVICES, INC.  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPROVAL OF THE APPLICATION WILL ALLOW THE APPLICANT TO DELETE THE EXISTING COVENANT ON THE SITE AND TO CHANGE THE ZONING OF THE PROPERTY FROM BU-1A AND IU-1 TO BU-1A TO PERMIT A SHOPPING CENTER ON THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SITE PARCEL ï¿½Aï¿½. THE APPLICANT ALSO SEEKS A ZONE CHANGE FROM BU-1A AND IU-1 TO IU-1 TO PERMIT A PRIVATE SCHOOL GRADES K-8TH FOR 772 STUDENTS, TO REDUCE THE PLAYGROUND AREA FOR THE SCHOOL AND A SPECIAL EXCEPTION TO WAIVE THE SPACING FROM THE UDB ON THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE PROPERTY PARCEL ï¿½Bï¿½   --  LOCATION:  THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF SW 136 STREET & SW 157 AVENUE, MIAMI- DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA. WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Vacate the decision of the Community Council Zoning Z-22-17 Mover: Joe A. Martinez Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Barreiro , Diaz REPORT: Commissioner Martinez introduced Mr. Jeff Bercow, attorney for the applicant, Orbe Services, Inc. Mr. Bercow, 200 South Biscayne Blvd., appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant.  He explained the nature of the applicantï¿½s request, noting he was appealing a denial by the Community Council that was based principally on traffic impacts, even though the Application received approval from the Department of Transportation and Public Works for the Traffic Operations Plan.  Mr. Bercow stated that he had begun working on a revised site plan; held meetings with the neighbors; and recently submitted the revised plan for review.  He requested that the Application be remanded to the Community Council to enable him to present the revised plan, and continue to work with the neighbors and area stakeholders. Commissioner Martinez noted at the time when the Application was heard by the Community Council, that body had a number of vacancies; they had since been filled, and he would like all of the members of the Community Council to have the opportunity to hear the Application. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vacate the decision of the Community Council and to remand the Application to the Community Council for further proceedings, with leave to amend. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-22-17. 2 171848 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-002  --  DISTRICT(S) 08  --  12499 HOLDINGS, LLC  --  REQUEST(S):  -  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM AU TO  RU-3M  --  LOCATION:  LYING SOUTH OF THEORETICAL SW 232 STREET, APPROXIMATELY 337.56' WEST OF SW 124 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA. WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t September 14, 2017 Zoning Z-25-17 Mover: Daniella Levine Cava Seconder: Jean Monestime Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Suarez , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read the title of the item into the record. Mr. Gilberto Pastoriza, 2525 Ponce de Leon, attorney for the applicant, appeared before the Board, noting this was an appeal from a decision by the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB), denying a re-zoning of the property from Agricultural to RU3M.  He clarified that the property was located south of 232nd Street and within walking distance of the Rapid Transit Busway, and US1.  Mr. Pastoriza stated that this denial was inconsistent with the County Code, the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) and State law.  He pointed out that the property was zoned agricultural, which requires one unit per five acres; and the CDMP amendment which was recently adopted by the County Commission allows from 6-13 units per acre.  He recalled that at a zoning hearing held in 2016 some of the commissioners voiced the opinion that more density should be allowed close to the highway.  He noted this Application made sense, because it would put density near the highway, and prevent urban sprawl going west.  Mr. Pastoriza stressed that all of the County departments were recommending approval of this Application, and urged the County Commission to overturn the decision of the CZAB, and approve the re-zoning of the property. Mr. Juan Carlos Lopez, 23401 SW 124th Ave., Miami, appeared before the Board, noting he owned a home across from the property that was the subject of this Application.  He stated that his neighborhood constituted a little Horse Country; and if the re-zoning were approved, it would affect the residentsï¿½ lifestyle and property values.  Mr. Lopez lamented that no traffic study had been undertaken; and the conclusions that the busway ridership would increase if the property was developed was based on assumptions. Mr. Bryan Throckmorton, 12299 SW 232nd Street, Miami, appeared before the Board and expressed his concern with the proposed development.  He said he and his family had lived in this neighborhood for 28 years and had witnessed many changes; they enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area.  Mr. Throckmorton lamented that having a multi-apartment building in the neighborhood would have a negative impact on the area; and would negatively affect traffic. Ms. Johanna Coppers, 23401 SW 124th Ave., Homestead, appeared before the Board, and stated that she and her family bought a beautiful house in the neighborhood one year ago.  She said she used to live in Doral; but she and her family wanted to live in the country.  Ms. Coppers noted when they moved in traffic was not a problem; however, recently, traffic had become heavier, and she feared that it would become worse if the proposed development was allowed. Mr. Jorge Cuadrado, 23451 SW 123rd Ave., Miami, appeared before the Board, noting he had lived in the neighborhood for 20 years.  He said he and his family moved there shortly after he retired from the United States Navy because they wanted space, peace and quiet.  Mr. Cuadrado recalled that at the last hearing which he attended near his home, hundreds of property owners expressed their opposition to this development. Commissioner Levine Cava said it gave her great pause to hear the concerns of the residents who were fearful that their lifestyle was threatened.  On the other hand, she pointed out that the CDMP had already been changed in accordance with the development along the transit way.  Commissioner Levine Cava requested some clarifications regarding the proposed development. Mr. Pastoriza said he believed that there were some misunderstandings because the advertisement for the Application indicated that the property was to be zoned RU3M, which included minimum apartment house districts.  He clarified that the applicant would not be constructing apartments, but rather two-story townhouses; and he displayed a rendering of the project. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question as to whether a covenant to the Application had been proffered to that effect, Mr. Pastoriza noted he would support an after-the-fact covenant which would provide that apartments would not be built, but rather two-story townhomes. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding the appropriate mechanism to ensure that apartments would not be built, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised that the appropriate mechanism would be for the applicant to voluntarily proffer a covenant providing that a particular site plan would be developed.  He noted this was a re-zoning application, which typically could not be subject to conditions.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel recommended that the application be deferred to provide the applicant sufficient time to prepare the covenant, as this would allow the County Commission to approve the application and a fully executed covenant at the same time. Commissioner Levine Cava noted the reason the Comprehensive Plan was changed along this corridor was to provide connectivity to the transit way, and to Rapid Transit for pedestrians and vehicles.  She pointed out that currently there was no developed through road at 232nd Street; and she inquired as to the plans to complete 232nd Street to US1, and as to the requirements for the developer to build a complete street segment along the front of the property on 232nd Street. Mr. Kogon noted through the plating process, the applicant was required to build 232nd Street in front of the property. Mr. Raul Pino, Chief of Planning, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, indicated that at this moment 232nd Street was not a dedicated right-of-way; through the development process, the developers to the east and to the west were constructing 232nd Street.  He pointed out that the connection to Dixie Highway was problematic because of the adjacent canal; consequently, staff was considering re-aligning the road slightly to the north.  However, Mr. Pino assured Commissioner Levine Cava that while vehicular connectivity was problematic, pedestrian connectivity could be provided to Dixie Highway. Commissioner Levine Cava noted connectivity was essential; and she inquired whether this could be included in a covenant. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel indicated that the covenant could provide that connectivity would be explored through the plating process; however, because of the lack of an engineering solution to the vehicular connectivity to Dixie Highway, it would not be possible to impose this as a requirement, at this time. Commissioner Levine Cava pointed out that there was more than one property, and she inquired whether the vehicles would be able to connect from the properties to the major corridors. Mr. Pastoriza indicated that the applicant owned both properties; the property that was adjacent to US1was already zoned RU3M; and staff was supportive of having both properties re-zoned to low-medium density residential.  Mr. Pastoriza stated that the applicant was planning to develop a townhouse complex on the second property. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired whether the applicant would agree to conditions requiring that a neighborhood street network be built to avoid having a cul-de-sac. Mr. Pastoriza stressed that there would be no cul-de-sac in the properties, as designed.  He said the applicant would agree to provide a pedestrian connection to US1. Mr. Kogon defined the RU3M designation, noting it was essentially a townhouse district, which only allowed a maximum of two stories. Commissioner Moss noted this was the type of discussion that the County Commission members should be having in the future; it involved a choice between moving the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) or allowing more density.  Commissioner Moss said in his district it was clear that he would prefer to allow more density along the transit way.  He pointed out that at some point the UDB may need to be moved.  He expressed his support for a deferral that would provide the time for the applicant to develop a covenant. Commissioner Sosa wondered whether it would be possible for the County Commission to approve the item pending the covenant.  She expressed her agreement with Commissioner Mossï¿½ observation that it was inevitable that the County would experience more density in the future; however, she said she would prefer for the density to take the form of two-story townhouses rather than apartment buildings, as a number of apartment buildings did not have sufficient parking.  Commissioner Sosa expressed her support for this type of controlled growth. Commissioner Monestime expressed his support for the deferral to provide time for the applicant to develop a covenant; and he said he agreed with Commissioner Mossï¿½ assessment that there should be more density along the transit way.  He pointed out that the residents appeared to be misinformed regarding the developerï¿½s intent regarding the property; and he inquired what steps could be taken in the future to better explain to the residents the nature of a proposed development.  Commissioner Monestime also suggested that perhaps the Code could be amended to avoid such confusion in the future. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised that it would be appropriate for the residents to speak with the Zoning staff and with the developer.  He suggested that the Code could be amended to adjust the title of the Zoning district to avoid confusion. Commissioner Jordan pointed out that Miami-Dade County was almost completely built with the exception of South Dade; and affordability was an important consideration. In response to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question regarding the price range of the units in the proposed development, Mr. Pastoriza stated that this would be a rental community. Mr. Irvin Grainer (phonetic spelling), 12999 Homestead, appeared before the Board, noting the primary intent of this development was to sell the townhomes in the range of $200,000.  He stated that if the units were not sold, they would be rented for $1500. Commissioner Moss questioned whether it would be necessary to defer the item.  He inquired whether an agreement could be reached regarding the terms of the covenant; and whether the County Commission could condition its approval on the execution of the covenant. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised that a long body of case law existed which prohibited conditioning a district boundary change; therefore, if the Applicant did not proffer an executed covenant, and the County took the Applicant to court, the judge may decide that the County did not have the ability to impose the condition in the first place. Responding to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question as to whether the case law was based on State or federal law, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted it was based on State law that was rooted in the issue of contract zoning; and this had been the County Attorneyï¿½s consistent advice for many years. Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question regarding whether the Countyï¿½s lobbyists could lobby the State Legislature to have the law rescinded, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel said he would study the possibility of contesting this law. Mr. Pastoriza acknowledged the existence of case law supporting the Assistant County Attorneyï¿½s advice; however, notwithstanding that case law, he promised that he would proffer the executed covenant within a week.  He recalled that many years ago, the County approved items pending receipt of an executed covenant. Commissioner Levine Cava said she believed that the covenant would be complicated, because it would include the nature of the homes, the pedestrian access, and road access. Therefore, she noted, in an abundance of caution, she would heed the Assistant County Attorneyï¿½s advice, and defer the item to have time to review the covenant.  Commissioner Levine Cava thanked the residents for coming.  She acknowledged that most of them had lived in this area for a long time, and that peace was fundamental to quality of life.  Nevertheless, she pointed out that Miami-Dade County would continue to expand, and it was inevitable that growth would have to occur in areas located close to the transit way.  Commissioner Levine Cava noted the County Commission was working very hard to ensure that the County had quality transit.  She said it was the Administrationï¿½s expectation that property values would increase because of the proposed development. Mr. Pastoriza said he wished to ensure that in drafting the covenant he met the wishes of the County Commission members.  He noted based on the discussion he believed that the commissioners wished the covenant to cover the two-story townhomes at the density afforded by the RU3M zoning, pedestrian access to US1 immediately, and in the future vehicular access to US1. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that the item would be considered at the September 14, 2017 Zoning meeting; and at that meeting the members of the public would not have the opportunity to speak, because they had been provided that opportunity today (07/20). Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to defer the item to the Zoning meeting of September 14, 2017.

Souto Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Edmonson , Heyman , Barreiro , Diaz REPORT: Commissioner Souto stated that he had received many e-mails regarding the Kendall Regional Medical Center and the Horse Country Association; and the e-mails indicated that the residents had concerns that needed to be addressed.  He noted the Horse Country Association was requesting a deferral of the item, because many of its members had travelled for the summer.  Commissioner Souto said for these reasons he was requesting deferral of the item until the Zoning meeting of September 14, 2017, in order to allow the residents of Horse Country the opportunity to express their concerns. Mr. Alex Tacsmith (phonetic spelling), Esq., 200 South Biscayne Blvd., attorney representing the Kendall Regional Medical Center, appeared before the Board, noting he had met with the neighbors over 20 times, and had exhausted all discussions with them.  He indicated that the neighbors were requesting concessions that were not part of the Application; as a result, they had been unable to reach an agreement. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to defer the item to the Zoning meeting of September 14, 2017. 4 171850 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-011  --  DISTRICT(S) 09  --  MIAMI-DADE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PHCD &  TPW  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS REQUESTING MODIFICATION OF THE LAND USE, DENSITY AND BUILDING HEIGHT REGULATING PLANS OF THE PERRINE COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER (PECUC) DISTRICT  --  LOCATION:  GENERALLY LOCATED SOUTH OF SW 184TH STREET (EUREKA DRIVE), WEST OF S.

Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½ request for clarification regarding the outstanding lien, Mr. Kogon clarified that he had recently been made aware that there was an outstanding lien of approximately $1,000 due to a violation, which was cleared in 2016 pertaining to debris that was left on a vacant lot.  He noted staff was in support of the Application; however, the Code was very specific regarding outstanding liens. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to defer the item to the Zoning meeting of September 14, 2017. 5 171851 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-044  --  DISTRICT(S) 01  --  ADVANCED LEARNING CHARTER SCHOOL, INC.

He closed the public hearing after no one appeared wishing to speak. Commissioner Jordan commended the applicant for working diligently to meet her concerns. Commissioner Sosa said she believed that the department had a plan to ensure that the expansion of the school would not affect traffic.

Mr. Javier Perez, 15338 SW 140 Street Miami, FL 33196, commented on his experience at the hospital and the outstanding care it provided to the community. Ms. Drialys Perez, 14861 SW 42 Lane Miami, FL 33185, recognized the need for additional parking at the hospital. Father Pedro Toledo, 5756 NW 112 Avenue Doral, FL 33178, Chaplain for Kendall Regional Medical Center. Ms. Karen Henington, 25360 SW 182 Avenue Miami, FL, commented on the need for additional hospital parking. Ms. Ana Ferreira, 12285 SW 51 Street Miami, FL 33175, noted the parking challenges she faced as a hospital employee. Mr. Carlos Acosta, 11871 SW 43 Street Miami, FL, said he supported the expansion but opined the application not being done in a balanced manner and did not consider the concerns of area residents. Mr. Alexander Tachmes, 200 S Biscayne Blvd Miami, FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant and reviewed a power point presentation describing Kendall Regional Medical Center (KRMC): Justifications for Requests: The hospital requires a 2-Story hospital addition and a new parking garage ï¿½\tRequests ï¿½\tSite Plan ï¿½\tProfessional Staff Recommendation ï¿½\tCompliance with Applicable review Criteria ï¿½\tHeights of Buildings on Campus ï¿½\tCommunity Outreach He pointed out in order to address the concerns of the neighbors; the permanent relocation of the helipad to the new two-story addition would result in a net reduction in noise level due to the higher location of the helipad. Mr. Brandon Haushalter, Chief Executive Officer, Kendall Regional Medical Center 10650 SW 68 Avenue Miami, FL 33156, provided an overview of the hospital; stated KRMC was a full service hospital servicing the needs of the community; and that the hospital had been recognized 10 out of the last 13 years as a top 100 hospital in the United States.  He also mentioned the hospital recently added graduate medical education and was a major teaching facility with over 100 medical residents. Mr. Haushalter continued with the power point presentation as follows: ï¿½\tAnnual Patient Treatments ï¿½\tAnnual Patient Volume Trends ï¿½\tServing the Growing Community ï¿½\tProposed Project Timeline Dr. Mark McKeneey, Chief of Trauma Kendall Regional Medical Center, 6575 Allison Road Miami Beach, FL, reviewed a power point presentation which supported the expansion: ï¿½\tRole of KRMC in the Community ï¿½\tBed Tower Expansion Project He noted approval of the proposed expansion was imperative in order to care for the patients in the community. Mr. Mark Warren, 1099 New York Avenue Washington, DC, reviewed a power point presentation and provided the specifics for helipad requirements to support a trauma hospital: ï¿½\tLocation of Helipad ï¿½\tPotential locations for a temporary Helipad ï¿½\tApproved Proposed Flight Paths ï¿½\tMiami-Dade County Flights ï¿½\tFrequency of Flights The following persons expressed concerns with and/or opposed the proposed application: Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Eutopia Court Coconut Grove, FL, appeared on behalf of the Bird-Kendall Homeownerï¿½s Association (typically referred to as Horse Country residents) who were located immediately south of the hospital.  He noted the HOA was concerned with this being the fourth expansion of the hospital since 2004; with issues related to the 9 floor parking garage and its related variance; and with the expansion resulting in a significant increase in the use of the hospital along with visual impacts.  He noted, as a result, the HOA was requesting an improved garage that included architectural elements, masked openings facing the residential neighborhood, and for the approval to coincide with the 40 foot 28 inch code requirement. Mr. Ernie Thomas, President, Horse Country Miami, 6050 SW 120 Avenue, Miami, FL, appeared on behalf of the most affected neighbors and hoped for an agreeable solution on the proposed conditions.  He noted a survey was conducted, 424 signatures were obtained, and entered, into the record, results regarding the relocation of the helipad, the size of the parking garage and traffic issues. Mr. Thomas reported the association asked area residents to support the moving of the helipad, but was requesting the Board change the relocation requirement to two years as opposed to the 3 years, and prior to any certificate of occupancy being issued.  With regards to the parking garage, he noted the association was requesting a six story garage along with architectural elements and privacy screening to protect the neighbors and a commitment from the hospital to not build on the parking lot located in Horse Country. Mr. Bill Riley, 1671 NW 16 Terrace Miami, FL, appeared on behalf of the Curbelo family, whose residence was located at 11880 SW 47 Street Miami, FL in Horse Country community.  He noted they supported responsible growth, but requested the Board not allow traffic in the Horse Country community; to direct the applicant to listen to the concerns of the residents; and to further review the impact of traffic through the residential community. In response to the comments made by the opposing side, Mr. Tachmes, clarified the hospital was seeking an increase of 56 beds; that the requested variance was located on the west side and would not have an effect on Horse Country which was located to the south; that once the two-story addition was completed, the temporary helipad would be removed and relocated to its original location; and that the garage would only be 10 feet higher than it currently was.  He also pointed out road closures were decided by the county. Chairman Bovo closed the floor to public comment. Commissioner Souto concurred with both sides; however noted Miami-Dade County was growing tremendously and there was a great need for medical care, notwithstanding the issues raised by the neighbors.  He accepted the expansion with the recommended conditions. Commissioner Heyman pointed out  a higher helipad would result in less noise for the neighbors and suggested the hospital buffer and landscape the garage to make it more aesthetic to the neighbors.  She stated she would support the item with the recommended suggestions. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding the construction timeframe for the removal of the helipad, Mr. Tachmes stated that two years was feasible barring no extraordinary weather conditions. Discussion was held between both parties regarding the removal of the temporary helipad and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the two-story addition. Commissioner Souto indicated efforts were being made to resolve the traffic issues in Horse Country and said he did not want any changes made in regards to the current road closures or to the parcel located to the South. Mr. Kogan clarified the property located to the South was zoned for EU1, a residential zoning district, that has special permission for unusual use. He advised expansions on that land would not be allowed without rezoning requirements and approval from the Board. By motion duly made, seconded and carried, the Board proceeded to modify staffï¿½s recommendation with the additional conditions: 1.  The applicant shall cooperate with the objectors and coordinate with Miami-Dade County to discourage traffic going through Horse Country to access the hospital. 2. Staff recommends an administrative site plan review process and the applicant shall submit revised plans showing appropriate screening and buffering of the garage. 3. No construction for shall be permitted on the southern parcel for non-core hospital uses and the covenant would be modified accordingly as necessary to incorporate these new conditions. 7/20/2017 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B 171846 Zoning HEARING NO. 16-246  --  DISTRICT(S) 10  --  KEEP BLEAU GREEN COMMITTEE, INC  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM GU, INTERIM DISTRICT TO RU-4L, LIMITED APARTMENT DISTRICT.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved Zoning Z-29-17 Mover: Xavier L. Suarez Seconder: Joe A. Martinez Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Monestime , Barreiro , Sosa , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogan, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory an Economic Resources, read the item into the record. Chairman Bovo opened the floor to public comments and the following persons appeared: Mayor Philip Stoddard, City of South Miami, 6130 Sunset Drive, South Miami, FL advised the Board this item was an appeal by the South Miami Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA).  He commented that this site went through a lawsuit that had been settled but the interest of the City of South Miami was not considered in a timely manner and they were not given the opportunity to provide significant input. Commissioner Suarez informed the Board that the South Miami CRA was the appellant and they were appealing the decision from the South Miami Rapid Transit Development Impact Committee (RTDIC). He mentioned this would be his first time hearing the merits of the case from both parties and he also advised the Board that the CRA was a hybrid agency made up of two (2) non-council members and five (5) council members including the Mayor. South Miami Commissioner Walter Harris, 7100 SW 64 Court, South Miami, FL spoke against the item and mentioned the unfair treatment the City of South Miami received. Mr. Thomas Pepy, 1450 Madruga Avenue Suite 202 Coral Gables, FL advised he represented the CRA and the Board members that voted in favor of this appeal.  He announced the CRA was challenging the parking variance due to lack of substantial evidence presented to determine if a parking variance would be appropriate.  Mr. Pepy advised originally this was a mixed used development and stated there was not enough evidence to support an additional variance from 25% -34%. He asked the Board to deny the variance and send it back for reconsideration. Councilwoman Peggy Broduer, 5685 SW 85th Street, South Miami, also asked the Board to deny this application, she noted the study was not done on the basis of actual usage and stressed how the residents would be greatly impacted by this variance. South Miami Commissioner Gabriel Edmond, 6241 SW 61 Street South Miami, FL appeared on behalf of the CRA and reported they were notified of this development only three months ago.  He asked the Board to deny the application to allow the committee time to reexamine the controversial issues that caused upheaval in the City of South Miami.  Mr. Edmond also requested the Boardï¿½s assistance in regards to affordable housing which continued to be a major issue in the City of South Miami. Mr. Hugo Arza 701 Brickell Avenue Miami, FL, attorney for the Treo Somi Station, LLC, explained there was a specific RTDIC for this case that was tasked with considering applications at county-owned Metro-rail stations.  He pointed out the process by which the zoning code was developed consisted of collaboration between the City of South Miami and Miami-Dade County (MDC) which was adopted in 2002. Mr. Arza pointed out an application was submitted in November 2016 and disagreed with the previous comments that the City of South Miami was not notified in a timely manner, as they would have been alerted at the time of filing.  He informed the Board the RTDIC was comprised of MDC department heads and members, along with two members from the City of South Miami, and that the application was presented before the City of South Miami Commission but not before the CRA; therefore he questioned the standing of the CRA to file an appeal without appearing or sending any notification regarding their objections to this application.  He explained the parking issues included staff recommendations that were relied on to support the requested parking reduction granted by the RTDIC; that a traffic study was conducted; and noted the fundamental reasons staff accepted the non-use variance was because of its compatibility and it was not detrimental to the community.  He also stated the evidence presented indicated this was the intended process, as called for by the code of MDC, and asked the Board to sustain the RTDIC decision and deny the appeal by the South Miami CRA. Mr. Lee Jacobs, 6860 SW 77 Terrace Miami, FL, noted this was a civil rights issue and opined the public was being left out of the system.  He also expressed concern with the lack of available affordable housing in the City of South Miami. Mr. Travis Williams, 6231 SW 62 Terrace South Miami, FL, mentioned he was a 15 year veteran that could not afford to reside in the city where he was born and raised.  He also stated this was publicly owned property; stressed the need for affordable housing in South Miami; and urged the Board to grant this appeal. Ms. Antoinette Fisher, 6211 SW 80 Street South Miami, FL, asked the Board to grant a time extension along with an expansion of this appeal.  She noted the need for affordable housing in South Miami; opined the entire process was a miscarriage of justice; and that the appeal should not have been limited to the parking variance. Seeing no other persons wishing to appear to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the floor to public comment. In response to the comments made earlier by Mr. Arza, Mr. Pepy informed the Board that this appeal was taken by the South Miami CRA and by individual members; Gabriel Edmond, Walter Harris, Madame Jackson and Levi Kelly who also attended the RTDIC meeting; therefore they had standing for this appeal.  Mr. Pepy argued there would be more cars on the street and referenced MDC ordinance 33.311 which stated a parking variance should not be granted if it was detrimental to the community standards.  Mr. Pepy requested the variance be overturned and remanded for further study. Mr. Arza clarified the only item before the Board was a parking variance, not an affordable housing issue.  He mentioned the appeal could not be expanded and indicated there was an opportunity for the public or anyone else to speak. Commissioner Suarez commented that the posture of this matter was a zoning decision made by a committee that was set up by the County specifically for this type of facility and said he was unsure how affordable housing was not included as part of the unsolicited bid process for this development. Responding to Commissioner Suarezï¿½ question, Mayor Stoddard advised that neither the City of South Miami nor the CRA were consulted when the Request for Proposal (RFP) was crafted and opined they were ignored by the County. Commissioner Suarez noted there was no legal issue or policy reason for objecting this application and accepted responsibility for not building in an affordable housing component.  He guaranteed the bulk of the tax increment obtained from this development would be used for affordable housing in the City of South Miami. Commissioner Sosa stated the quality of life was being taken away from the residents and noted the need for the Board to adapt to the mentality of the younger generation, which involved the use of cars. She inquired about the outcome of the appeal based on an approval or denial. Mr. Kogon clarified that the applicantï¿½s request was to reduce the amount of parking spaces from the required 25% to 34%. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised Commissioner Sosa that the appeal was only related to the parking variance. Commissioner Sosa said she usually concurred with the decision of the District Commissioner, but expressed concern for the lack of inclusion towards the City of South Miami during this process. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed concern with the nonexistence of affordable housing within this project. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question, Assistant County Attorney Libhaber explained that the RFP process dated back to 1999 and the company that was awarded the contract did not comply with all of the requirements of MDC; subsequently an approval of a settlement was brought before the Board.   He reported there were no additional requirements associated with the approval of the settlement and new lease terms. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained if the appeal was accepted and the decision of the RTDIC was rejected, then the applicant would have to go back before the RTDIC with a new plan. Mr. Arza noted if the balance of the request was granted, then all other aspects would remain approved and the developer could change the mix of use in order to meet the requirements for the parking variance.  He added that even if the entire project was sent back for reconsideration, it was more than likely that the developer would not include an affordable housing component. Commissioner Martinez mentioned the Boardï¿½s focus was on density and this project correlated with that issue; therefore, he was supportive of this application. Mr. Arza reassured Commissioner Souto that the Treo Somi Station, LLC. did not have ties to any previous developers that were indicted. Commissioner Jordan inquired whether the location of the property along the transit lines was within the bounds of the CRA and if the CRA was presented with a significant role during the development of this project. Responding to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question, Mr. Kogon advised the property was within the bounds of the CRA; however, under the RTDIC regulations, there was no remedy for submittal to the CRA only to the City of South Miami. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel informed the Board that the City of South Miami had two seats on the RTDIC committee and that they were intimately a part of the process review from the beginning of the application. Commissioner Jordan commented that it was disrespectful not to include the City of South Miami and the CRA in this decision making process and pointed out that the Board needed to review the rules in regards to the RTDIC.  She indicated the Board locked themselves out from helping the community, but announced she supported the item based on what was being appealed. Commissioner Heyman mentioned the rules, based on how CRAï¿½s were constructed, was governed by the State of Florida and not solely the responsibility of the Board of County Commissioners (BCC).  She also expressed support for the item. Commissioner Jordan announced, for the record, that she would like to reserve the right with the County Attorneyï¿½s office to make amendments to the RTDIC rules and regulations. By motion duly made, seconded and carried, the Board proceeded to approve staffï¿½s recommendations and denied the appeal.

Mr. Alberto Guzman, 9320 SW 100 Street Miami, FL 331769, said he had three children that attended the school and expressed support for the application. Ms. Rocio Leza, 9905 SW 90 Avenue Miami, FL 33176, stated her son attended the school and she supported the application. Mr. Santiago Olea, 201 Crandon Blvd Apt. 437 Key Biscayne, FL 33149, advised he was the student body President; he stated the school has impacted his life in a very positive manner and supported the application. Seeing no other persons wishing to appear to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the floor to public comment. Mr. Jeffery Bercow, 200 S Biscayne Blvd. Miami, FL attorney representing the applicant, reported there were over 900 letters of support in favor of the expansion, many of which were from immediate neighbors.  He noted several meetings were held with the Continental Park Homeowners Association and stated their recommendations were incorporated into the application conditions. Mr. Bercow advised the application requested a small increase in the number of students and a few other changes that would allow normal school activities.  He mentioned the school was currently approved for 524 students and 100 preschool children and the proposed modification to the plan would increase the existing campus to 32,000 square feet. Mr. Peter Cohen, Rivera Preparatory School Associate Director, 5820 SW 118 Street, Miami, FL, spoke about the important educational role Riviera played in South Florida since 1950; he stated the requested approvals would allow the school to continue to provide the very best in education; and asked for the Boardï¿½s support. Mr. Rolando LLanes, 8323 NW 12 Street Doral, FL, architect for Riviera Preparatory School, reviewed the previously approved plan for the existing campus as well as the newly proposed architectural design. Mr. Bercow pointed out this application satisfied two objective county standards test for transportation impacts of schools and that the traffic operation plan was approved by the traffic engineering section of the Public Works department.  He clarified the request fell into two categories; expansion of the school and changes needed to allow the school to function like other schools in Miami-Dade County.  Mr. Bercow explained they were requesting a special acceptance to extend the school to the south; modification of the hearing approved plan to effect that change; and proposing to modify enrollment from 524-800 students; all of which were satisfied by the Miami-Dade County code.  A few other modifications mentioned by Mr. Bercow included the addition of tennis courts; modifying the time for outdoor activities from 6am-11pm on weekdays and 10am-11pm on weekends; and limiting outdoor events to 10 times a year. He announced the applicantï¿½s intent to withdraw Item #5 from the request and that the item be bifurcated in order to defer Item #6. Commissioner Suarez introduced, into the record, letters he received from William Rowe, Summer Diaz, Bruce Brockhouse and Renee and Lillian Sedano.  He mentioned the discrepancy in the calculation for the number of allowed students. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised Commissioner Suarez that the applicantï¿½s request limited the amount of students to 800. Commissioner Suarez expressed concern with the 50% increase in student enrollment and suggested that the item be deferred. Mr. Bercow commented, in order to expedite the approval of this application, they would be willing to reduce the number of students to 725. Commissioner Martinez announced that he would follow the District Commissioner with the approval of 725 students but questioned the amount of restrictions listed in the original zoning process for this land. Mr. Bercow advised Commissioner Levine Cava that the 11 p.m. weekly curfew was in the existing approval; reported there were currently no preschool students; and added they would not be pursuing that component of education. By motion duly made, seconded and carried, the Board proceeded to modify staffï¿½s recommendation to reduce the number of students to 725; withdraw request # 5; bifurcate request # 6 and necessitate the conditions to allow modifications to the site plan to show removal of the tennis courts setback request. 3 172354 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-175 -- DISTRICT(S) 04 -- WEST AVENTURA DEVELOPERS, LLC.

He emphasized the application has been ongoing for two years and noted the deferral request was due to the filing of a DIC claim by the appellant  ten (10) months ago.  He advised the jurisdictional issues have been resolved with the Assistant County Attorneyï¿½s office and urged the board to follow the advice offered by their counsel. Mr. Jeffrey Berkow, 200 S Biscayne Blvd, Miami, attorney representing Jockey Club 3, stated his client supported the deferral request. Commissioner Suarez expressed concern regarding the language introduced and issues raised for this deferral request. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced this was an unusual process and informed the Board in Chapter 2 of the Code of the planning section, the County had a process for administrative review of vested claims that could be raised based on a zoning application.  He noted Mr. Martos statement was incorrect and clarified the advice he provided declared a deferral was not required due to the filing of a vested rights claim. In response to Commissioner Heymanï¿½s question, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised Commissioner Heyman she would be briefed on the process. Commissioner Heyman apologized to the public for not being afforded a reasonable opportunity to speak and requested to discuss the vested rights and compound issue with the County Attorneyï¿½s Office.  She suggested all parties review the application, agree on a feasible resolution, and urged attorneys from both sides to afford the information to their community clients. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory an Economic Resources, recommended deferring the application to the April 26, 2018 meeting. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted, for the record, it was appropriate for the application to be heard before the Board as opposed to being remanded to CZAP as previously stated by Mr. Maxwell.

IN ADDITION, THE APPLICANTS ALSO SEEK TO REZONE A 62-ACRE PARCEL WITHIN THE DRI PROPERTY FROM IU-2 TO BU-2.  --  LOCATION: LYING SOUTH OF MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND SR 836, ON BOTH SIDES OF NW 57 AVENUE AND NORTH OF NW 7 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t May 31, 2018 Zoning Z-8-22 Mover: Rebeca Sosa Seconder: Barbara J. Jordan Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Monestime , Heyman , District 5-Vacant , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Joseph Goldstein, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, counsel for WRC Properties LLC, appeared before the Board to request the foregoing application be deferred to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for May 17, 2018, in order to allow sufficient time to continue discussing the issues with the oppositionï¿½s representatives and be able to reach an agreement. He noted the parties were currently engaged in discussions to try to resolve the issues prior to the application being considered by the Board. Mr. Gilberto Pastoriza, Weiss Serota Helfman Cole & Bierman, 2525 Ponce de Leon, Miami, Florida, counsel for the opposition, appeared before the Board and stated the opposition agreed with the request to defer the application. NOTE: Consideration of the foregoing application was postponed until a later time during the meeting to await for Commissioner Sosaï¿½s arrival. Pursuant to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s question, Mr. Goldstein advised the request to defer would allow for continuance of meaningful and very hopeful discussions that were started earlier that morning and could result in changes to the application that were acceptable to both parties, the applicant and the opposition. It was moved by Commissioner Sosa that the foregoing zoning application be deferred. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the zoning application would be deferred with leave to amend to allow for any proposed changes, and the deferral would be for the Zoning Hearing scheduled for May 17, 2018. Pursuant to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s inquiry relating to whether deferring to May 17, 2018, would provide sufficient time to the County Administration to review proposed changes, Assistant Director Nathan Kogon advised that timeframe provided insufficient time to review new requests; and if the applicant only presented withdrawals of certain requests and no new requests, the timeframe was sufficient. Pursuant to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s request to have the foregoing application deferred to June or July 2018, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised had objected to a deferral to June 2018. It was moved by Commissioner Sosa that the foregoing zoning application be deferred with leave to amend to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for July 19, 2018. Mr. Goldstein requested the foregoing zoning application be deferred to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for May 31, 2018. Chairman Bovo announced he would make a request at the end of the meeting to include in the Boardï¿½s calendar a Zoning Hearing for Thursday, May 31, 2018, at 9:30 a.m., to consider several applications. Commissioner Sosa reiterated that the foregoing application be deferred to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for July 19, 2018, to allow sufficient time for the County Administration to review proposed changes due to the complexity of the subject matter. Mr. Goldstein clarified that the content of the proposed changes would be withdrawals and some clarifications. Upon conclusion of the foregoing discussion, it was moved by Commissioner Sosa that the Board of County Commissioners defer with leave to amend the foregoing zoning application to the Zoning Hearing to be scheduled for May 31, 2018, pursuant to the request of Chairman Bovo. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan; and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 9-0 (Commissioners Diaz, Heyman, and Monestime were absent). 2/22/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B 181021 Zoning HEARING NO. Z2016000241 --  DISTRICT(S) 09  --  SOMERSET ACADEMY, INC. AND SCHOOL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT QUAIL ROOST, LLC. --  REQUEST(S):\t- THIS APPLICATION WAS BIFURCATED TO ALLOW THE APPLICATION OF AN ADDITIONAL NON-USE VARIANCE REQUEST TO ALLOW A PROPOSED HIGH SCHOOL COMPONENT FOR THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CHARTER SCHOOL SPACED LESS THAN REQUIRED FROM THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB). WITH THE BIFURCATED REQUEST, THE APPLICANTS ALSO SEEK TO MODIFY A CONDITION OF THE PRIOR RESOLUTION TO ALLOW THE HIGH SCHOOL USE.  --  LOCATION: 19701 SW 127 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.  WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved as amended Zoning Z-2-18 Mover: Dennis C. Moss Seconder: Joe A. Martinez Vote: 8 - 1 No: Cava Absent: Heyman , District 5-Vacant , Sosa , Diaz REPORT: Assistant Director Nathan Kogon, Development Services Division, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests and no waivers. Mr. Hugo Arza, counsel for the applicant, Somerset Academy, Inc., appeared before the Board and explained the neighborhoodï¿½s need for the expansion of the existing charter school, noting there was no need to defer the entire application due to the noticing error.  He advised that the issue of deferring this item with leave to amend until the Zoning Hearing scheduled for September 27, 2018, had been discussed with the County Attorneyï¿½s Office. Assistant Director Kogon explained that the additional request dealt with the issue of Urban Development Boundary (UDB) since the high school portion of the application required an additional non-use variance because the Miami-Dade County Code required a minimum of one (1) mile; but that requirement could be overcome through a special exemption and a non-use variance. Therefore, the Grades K-8 component of the application could be approved; and the high school component would be brought back before the Board for approval at the next regular scheduled Zoning Hearing. Following a brief discussion among Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel, Assistant Director Kogon, and Mr. Arza regarding Request #3, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the high school component needed to be taken out from the other request. Assistant Director Kogon noted the condition stated in the Countyï¿½s staff report reflected the Grades K-8 component appropriately. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing; and hearing no one wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Moss, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel, and Assistant Director Kogon regarding the criteria and process used to approve applications in proximity to the UDB and to approve charter schools. Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½s questions, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that, in the past, the School Board had submitted to the County reports outlining the total count of student stations available; but they were no longer disseminating that information to the County.  Mr. Kerbel suggested that the Board should request that the School Board begin to provide that information again. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Moss, Assistant Director Kogon, and Assistant Director Darlene Fernandez regarding traffic flow problems and whether the issues of proximity to the UDB and total number of student stations available were taken into consideration prior to determining whether the application should be approved. Assistant Director Kogon affirmed Commissioner Mossï¿½s comments that the applicant would have to conform to the applicationï¿½s condition requiring staggered shifts at arrival/dismissal times. Mr. Arza advised the staggered shifts at arrival/dismissal times were included in the conditions established for the approval of the application and Condition #12 for Requests #2 and #4 through #6 required that the applicants submit an annual traffic report for review by the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) and the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) prior to the issuance of the annual Certificate of Use. Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½s question relating to Condition #8 and whether the request for a high school would exceed the 1,600 maximum number of students, Assistant Director Kogon responded the proposed high school would not exceed the maximum number of students because those students had been included in the total number of 1,600. In response to Commissioner Mossï¿½s question relating to addressing the additional 600 students for the high school component at a later time, Assistant Director Kogon clarified he wished to have approved today 1,000 student stations for Grades K-8 and have revisited the remaining 600 student stations at the time the high school component was brought back before the Board. Mr. Arza explained the application was being deferred due to the noticing error, but the applicant intended to come back as soon as possible. He stated that the Board had heard in the presentation the real purpose and need of the application, and it was going to be dedicated as a high school. He also explained that the site and the traffic impact study was done for 1,600 students and fabricating the number of student stations would create a subset to be reviewed at a later time. He noted only one building would be built; and if the additional number of student stations was not approved at a later time, the building size would be too large for the initially approved number of student stations. Therefore, the applicant would not move forward with the school. He suggested to place a condition that would require the number of students to remain at 1,600; and if the applicant failed to submit or come back before the Board within a reasonable amount of time, the number of students would be reduced to 1,000 or a different number at that time.  He stated that the traffic study analysis should not have to be redone for an additional 600 students. Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½s request, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised that the applicantï¿½s counsel suggestion stating that Grades K-8 be limited to a maximum of 1,600 student stations was workable. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel later clarified that Condition #8 be split in two (2) conditions and should state ï¿½that the charter school be limited to Grades K-8; then, a new condition would be added and renumbered as Condition #9 to state ï¿½that the charter school shall be limited to a maximum of 1,600 students and that if the charter school operator or applicant shall be required to apply for an increase in grades to include a high school within 180 days, and if not, the school shall be limited to a maximum 1,000 students.ï¿½ Commissioner Moss and Mr. Arza agreed with the recommendation made by Assistant County Attorney Kerbel to split Condition #8 in two (2) conditions. Commissioner Levine Cava made it very clear she was familiar with the traffic patterns and parking problems associated with the area surrounding the proposed charter school, and she had received a number of complaints about the traffic and parking problems in that area.  She noted there had been no enforcement of the traffic plan in place. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to enforcement of the traffic plan, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the general enforcement responsibility was under the jurisdiction of the County zoning approval; therefore, the County Administration would be responsible for the enforcement of the traffic plan based on the conditions established for approval of the application. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding how to determine if there was adequate enforcement of the conditions established for the approval of the application, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained constituents complaints to the Department relating traffic problems were investigated to determine whether there was evidence that the applicant failed to comply with the Traffic Operation Plan (TOP); consequently, the applicant would be required to be in compliance before the Certificate of Use (COU) was renewed. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Levine Cava and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel, and Assistant Director Kogon relating to compliance with the TOP, traffic problems within the area, and the acceptable level of service for the impacted roadways within that community. Assistant Director Darlene Fernandez, Traffic Engineering, Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW), stated the Department had imposed conditions on the school requiring that a traffic signal be installed at SW 125th  Avenue with the option of a left turn restriction for southbound traffic at the intersection; and since this was a Florida Department Of Transportation (FDOT) roadway, it also required approval from that agency.  She stated the school would be unable to operate if those conditions were not met. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question, Assistant Director Fernandez advised the installation of the traffic light was required at the intersection of Quail Roost and SW 125th Avenue. Following a brief discussion between Commissioner Levine Cava and Assistant Director Kogon on how the traffic impact on the neighborhood was assessed, Commissioner Levine Cava expressed her concern for the approval of 1,600 students since there was a nearby school with one third (1/3) the number of students on a property the same size of the subject property. She asked that the Board consider approving a lower number of students like 600 rather than 1,600 because she was unable to support that level of students. Pursuant to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question regarding the State of Floridaï¿½s statute giving preference to school of choice, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained it was not preference but rather an important consideration under the statute. He stated that it was not strictly need- based, based on the number of students stations; but it affected the analysis. In regards to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question relating to the School Boardï¿½s report outlining the number of student stations available and having a representative available to answer questions at Board meetings to address those issues, Assistant Director Kogon stated that the Department requested that information for all applications; but the School Board had decided not to continue providing that information. Pursuant to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question relating to what could be done to require that the School Board continue to provide that data to the County, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated the School Board had the discretion to determine what to provide; and that question could be explored at a higher level to see what could be done to get that information. He noted that, if it was a public record issue, it could be demanded; but if the information had to be created, it was a different question. Commissioner Jordan stated that an extenuating circumstance would require that the School Board provide the information to this Board; and she asked that Assistant County Attorney Kerbel prepare an appropriate legislation to require that the School Board must collaborate with the County in providing certain information required by the State or in joint School Board meetings. She asked that the proposed legislation be prepared for the next scheduled Board meeting. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the Countyï¿½s interlocal agreements with the School Board District regarding charter schools, site selection, and school concurrencies, including if there were other opportunities for further legislation by this Board, would be reviewed to determine what information the School Board was already required to provide to the County. Commissioner Jordan noted that, if there were requirements based on the interlocal agreements, the School Board should be reminded that the County would like to continue that relationship; and she wished to be provided with comprehensive information about the schools. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Jordan, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel, and Assistant Director Kogon regarding the noticing errors that caused this item and other items to be deferred. Discussion ensued among Vice Chairwoman Edmonson, Assistant Director Fernandez, and Mr. Arza regarding who had conducted the traffic study analysis. Chairman Bovo clarified there was a motion on the floor to approve the application as amended. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion included the following: 1.\tTo approve Request #1 2.\tTo approve modified Request #2 to permit the Grades K-8 3.\tTo require that Request #3 come back before the Board for approval 4.\tTo approve modified Request #4 to only allow Grades K-8 5.\tTo approve Requests #5 and #6 6.\tTo approve that Condition #8 be split into two conditions to state ï¿½that the charter school be limited to Grades K-8; then, a new condition would be added and renumbered as Condition #9 to state ï¿½that the charter school shall be limited to a maximum of 1,600 students and that if the charter school operator or applicant shall be required to apply for an increase in grades to include a high school within 180 days, and if not, the school shall be limited to a maximum 1,000 students.ï¿½ Pursuant to Commissioner Mossï¿½s inquiry regarding the reference in the application to 1,500 students, Mr. Hugo Arza advised there were already one hundred (100) students enrolled at the location; but the maximum capacity of the school would remain at 1,600. Commissioner Moss advised the members of the Board needed to be provided with additional information to enable them to make informative decisions to better determine whether the school was necessary and its impact on the current student stations. Commissioner Moss advised that he would like for the County Administration to conduct a review of the traffic circulation plan and the current traffic problems within the area of SW 127th Avenue and determine if enforcement implementation was necessary in connection with the issue of the Academir schools and that the findings of the review be brought back before the Board. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised that the motion should include a waiver of the timeframe required to refile after an application was approved. Commissioner Moss accepted including in the motion the waiver of the timeframe required to refile after an application was approved. There being no further comments or objections, the members of the Board proceeded to take a vote on the foregoing zoning application as amended. The foregoing zoning application was adopted as amended by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-2-18. C 180352 Zoning HEARING NO.

Mr. Richard Perez, 701 Brickell Avenue, counsel for South Riviera Investments No. 2, Inc., appeared before the Board to explain the purpose of the school. He stated that the school met the needs of the community, which were not being adequately fulfilled by any other school in this area. He also explained the details of the zoning applicationï¿½s requests. He presented a PowerPoint presentation to explain the proposed zoning application and its traffic impact. He reviewed the three additional conditions the applicant had included in the application pursuant to commitments the applicant made to the areaï¿½s residents. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing zoning application: 1. \tMs. Patsy Cabrera, 16875 SW 300 Street, Homestead, Florida 2. \tMs. Darlene Soler, 29795 sW 143 Street, Homestead, Florida 3. \tMr. Kenneth Forbes, 25121 SW 120 Place, Princeton, Florida 4. \tMr. Victor Dominguez, 11786 SW 238 Street, Homestead, Florida 5. \tMr. Alain Diaz, 24287 SW 114 Court, Homestead, Florida 6. \tMr. Erik Lorenzo, 11491 SW 236 Avenue, Homestead, Florida 7. \tMr. Ruben Diaz, 24555 SW 112 Avenue, Homestead, Florida The following persons appeared before the Board in opposition to the foregoing zoning application: 1. \tMr. JL Demps, Jr., 11025 SW 223 Street, Goulds, Florida 2. \tMs. Marilyn Rolfs, 24371 SW 123 Avenue, Princeton, Florida 3. \tMs. Jacqueline Lopez, 24125 SW 120 Avenue, Princeton, Florida 4. \tMs. Jacqueline Rivera, 12412 SW 250 Terrace, Princeton, Florida 5. \tMr. Roger Jackson, 24350 SW 122 Avenue, Princeton, Flori 6. \tMr. Willie Abascal, 24540 SW 122 Avenue, Princeton, Florida 7. \tMr. Roger Rolfs, 24371 SW 123 Avenue, Princeton, Florida 8. \tMr. Alain Diaz, 24287 SW 114 Court, Homestead, Florida There being no other persons wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Perez advised the oppositionï¿½s issues were about traffic problems and the needs of the children from that area, noting the school was being built with modern techniques to limit the impact on the roadways.  He stated they had worked extremely hard to alleviate the traffic problems and had developed a plan to alleviate those problems. Consequently, they had added conditions to improve SW 120th Avenue, which was adjacent to the applicantï¿½s property; and added an enormous amount of stacking. He explained how those improvements would alleviate the stacking problem. He also explained the need for the proposed school was supported by the overcapacity in the thirteen (13) existing schools within that area. He noted the School Board was not planning to build any additional schools within that area, and there were additional residents moving into the subject area. Therefore, a need for additional student stations existed, and this was the place to build additional modern schools with modern techniques that would limit the impact. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed her appreciation for being provided with the school data analysis report, which had not been provided for the previous discussion. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Perez regarding the information in the school data analysis report relating to schools within Goulds and the traffic problems within the vicinity of SW 248th Street. Mr. Perez advised the applicant had agreed to pay for a traffic signal study for SW 122th Avenue; and if the study indicated the need for the traffic signal, the applicant would be willing to pay for the installation of that traffic signal. He stated the application included a condition requiring to have trained traffic personnel or police officers that would also significantly facilitate the traffic to and from SW 120th Avenue. In connection with Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to having the applicant meet with the neighbors, Mr. Juan Mayol, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, stated they had already met with most of the neighbors residing within the vicinity of SW 120th Avenue; and the concerns expressed were about SW 120th Avenue becoming a north corridor for the families residing in Silver Palms if opened. Consequently, two conditions were negotiated to include the provision of installing a traffic signal at SW 122nd Avenue since it would be a more appropriate north-south corridor. He stated that it had been agreed that SW 120th Avenue would not be improved beyond the schoolï¿½s property, and the school had no intention of improving it.  He noted that County staff was amenable to terminating the proposed improvement at that avenue, but it did not mean that the County would be unable to improve SW 120th Avenue in the future. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Mayol regarding the serious traffic problems within the subject area. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Perez regarding the outdoor recreational space and the Countyï¿½s requirements. In connection with Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to whether the playground would be available to the community, Mr. Perez advised that the school was going to be opened to everyone. He stated the area had a need for after school activities; but if the details could be negotiated, Mr. Diaz would be amenable to that. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s inquiry relating to car pools and including transportation amenities, Mr. Perez advised they currently had an extensive service to pick up and transport the children to the facilities for after-school care. He stated that all of those options were under review at this time since public schools did not provide that type of transportation service. Commissioner Levine Cava stated that, even though the subject area had an overabundance of schools, the area had a growing population. She also stated that she wished public schools were more responsive and provided more options including after school programs because many in the community would like to see more of these options. Commissioner Levine Cava moved to have this zoning application deferred with leave to amend in order to have some of the issues discussed today reviewed to include further conversations with the neighbors to see if some accommodations could be implemented. It was moved by Commissioner Levine Cava that the Board of County Commissioners defer the foregoing zoning application with leave to amend to include further discussions with the neighbors to determine if further accommodations that addressed transportation and recreational space issues could be provided. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Monestime, and the floor was opened for discussion. Pursuant to Assistant County Attorney Kerbelï¿½s question, Commissioner Levine Cava advised this application could be deferred for two (2) months. Mr. Perez advised the applicant was amenable to meeting immediately. Commissioner Levine Cava agreed to deferring the foregoing zoning application to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for June 21, 2018, as suggested by Assistant County Attorney Kerbel. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Sosa and Assistant Director Kogon regarding the closing of roads and the availability of recreational space. Commissioner Sosa expressed her concerns for the closing of roads, insufficient recreational space, and the density in that area, and the proposed setbacks due to its incompatible with the neighborhood and inconsistency with the CDMP. She advised that she would like clarification on all of those issue when the foregoing application came back before the Board. Commissioner Levine Cava advised she would be pleased to see a smaller student population with more recreational space and asked that the issue of the requested setbacks be addressed. Commissioner Moss requested that the School Board be asked to provide to the County information regarding total number of student stations available within an area and have a representative available to respond to concerns. Assistant Director Kogon advised that the Office of Development Services would provide to the Board that information in the future since it could be obtained from the School Boardï¿½s website even if the School Board failed to provide it. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced the foregoing zoning application would be deferred to the June 21, 2018, Zoning Hearing without re-advertisement unless any of the amendments required re-advertisement. Upon concluding the foregoing discussion, the members of the Board proceeded to take a vote. 2 181023 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-040 --  DISTRICT(S) 08  --  PERSEA, LLC, ET AL. --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANTS ARE SEEKING APPROVAL TO PERMIT A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM AU, AGRICULTURE DISTRICT TO EU-M, SINGLE-FAMILY MODIFIED ESTATE DISTRICT.

Jordan Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Monestime , Heyman , District 5-Vacant , Diaz REPORT: Assistant Director Nathan Kogon, Development Services Division, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting 41 protests were filed and there were no waivers. Mr. Juan Mayol, 701 Brickell Avenue, counsel for the applicant, appeared before the Board to explain the purpose of the foregoing application, noting it would not impact the historical structure located within the subject property. He explained the progression of the foregoing zoning application; and the applicant had proffered a declaration of restrictions that tied the application to an EUS plan, limited the number of units, required a minimum house and lot size, provided a landscape buffering next to the Tropical Audubon Society, requested waiver of sidewalks and street lightning, agreed to provide improvements on 292nd Street, provided a dedicated right turn lane to facilitate access to Krome Avenue, and included a provision requiring the consent of the neighbors if anyone ever pursued an increase in density for this property. Mr. Mayol urged the Board to approve the modified application. The following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1. \tMs. Arlene Samalion, 26251 SW 162 Avenue, Redland, Florida 2. \tMr. David  Tracey, 18001 SW 291 Street, Homestead, Florida 3. \tMs. Pat Milone, 29325 SW 202 Avenue, Redland, Florida 4. \tMs. Maria Drotar, 17990 SW 296 Street, Redland, Florida 5. \tMr. Mike Hatcher, 25145 SW 144 Avenue, Redland, Florida Mr. Mayol advised they had come to an agreement with most of the residents, noting that the Board could not expect to meet the demands of 34,000 residents moving into the area annually by holding densities down inside of the Urban Development Boundary (UDB), even though the residents residing outside of the UDB line wished to hold the line, preserve their way of life, and the character of the area. Mr. Mayol advised the subject parcel was located inside of the UDB; and it was not designated for agricultural uses since it was included in the Master Plan for estate density.  He stated that it would support urban development, and the request for EUS in lieu of EUN provided for a larger lot size and front setback. He said that the property ownersï¿½ rights had to be taken into consideration after the property owners had farmed the area for many generations and had elected not to farm the property any longer. Consequently, the property ownersï¿½ rights versus the interests of the community would be balanced by maintaining the density as low as possible. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed her concerns for the loss of agricultural land, which was contributing to the decline of the agricultural sector and leading to its demise; and she asked Mr. Mayol if the area outside of the UDB still had thirty (30) acres that could be preserved for agricultural purposes and had some right to development that would compensate for the loss of this agricultural land. Mr. Mayol asked to be allowed time to research Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question and comeback with a response. Commissioner Levine Cava asked that Mr. Mayol meet with the residents to explain to them the proposed changes and bring back to the Board feedback. It was moved by Commissioner Levine Cava that the Board of County Commissioners defer the foregoing zoning application to the Zoning Hearing scheduled for May 31, 2018, to allow the applicant to meet with the residents to explain the proposed changes and bring back before the Board feedback from the residents. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan; and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 9-0 (Commissioners Diaz, Heyman, and Monestime were absent). 3 181024 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-139 --  DISTRICT(S) 08  --  SFI PALM TREE FARMS, LLC.  --  REQUEST(S):   THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO CHANGE THE ZONING FROM AU TO BU-1A IN ORDER TO ALLOW A COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH ACCOMPANYING NON-USE VARIANCES ON A 7.12 ACRE PORTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND TO PERMIT A ZONE CHANGE FROM AU TO RU-3M IN ORDER TO PERMIT A TOWNHOUSE DEVELOPMENT FOR 283 UNITS ON THE REMAINING 24.20 ACRE PARCEL WITH ACCOMPANYING NON-USE VARIANCES.  --  LOCATION:   LYING IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF SW 248TH STREET AND SW 112TH AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

He advised that he had not spoken or been briefed by the staff member residing in the subject area, and this fact would not impact his ability to be impartial on this application. Assistant Director Nathan Kogon, Development Services Division, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Juan Mayol, counsel for applicant, SFI Palm Tree Farms LLC, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared before the Board to make a PowerPoint presentation to explain the foregoing application.  He noted that all the neighbors had expressed their agreement with the foregoing proposal. Commissioner Levine Cava advised that she would like to have complete streets built, and that policy should be included to the best of our ability. Mr. Mayol stated that the applicant would amenable to building complete streets if it was part of the cross-section that the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) wished them to develop. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing application by a waiver of the hand: 1. \tMr. Hank Combe, 25217 SW 117 Place, Homestead, Florida 2. \tMr. Willie Dowdell, 1518 E Mowry Drive, Apartment #201, Homestead, Florida 3. \tMr. Charles Mathis, 26725 SW 138 Avenue, Naranja, Florida 4. \tMs. Robin Edgecomb, 13775 SW 268 Street, Naranja, Florida 5. \tMr. Ajai Sturdivant, 26043 SW 133 Place, Princeton, Florida 6. \tMs. Clara Sturdivant, 26043 SW 133 Place, Princeton, Florida 7. \tMs. Gladean Buran, 27020 SW 144 Court, Miami, Florida 8. \tMs. Laporsha Sturdivant, 26043 SW 133 Place, Princeton, Florida 9. \tMs. Mary Jackson, 13360 SW 154 Terrace, Miami, Florida 10. \tMr. Marvin Wilson, 13795 SW 268 Street, Naranja, Florida 11. \tMs. Bertha Lee Jones, 10885 SW 218 Terrace, Miami, Florida 12. \tMs. Antonia Andrews, 824 E Mowry Drive, Apartment #1219, Homestead, Florida 13. \tMr. Carolyn Edgecomb, 13795 SW 268 Street, Naranja, Florida 14. \tMs. Joyce Williams, 30603 SW 152 Place, Homestead, Florida 15. \tMr. Ken Forbes, P.O.

In connection with Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to the lack of road connectivity to the neighbors in Artesa, Assistant Director Kogon advised that the department  shared the same philosophy that more arteries and connections allowed for better traffic flow. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Mayol regarding the issue of improving transportation, implementing the services of a transportation circulator, and providing more road connectivity. In regards to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s suggestion relating to using CCD as a mechanism to mitigate transportation, Mr. Mayol advised an inter local agreement with the County was needed to provide that mitigation. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised that the suggestion of implementing a circulator was within the scope of this application and using CCD as a mechanism to address transportation issues within this area was also an idea that could be explored at an appropriate time. Commissioner Levine Cava advised she expected the redesigning of the subject street would include building complete streets and bicycle and pedestrian accessibility. It was moved by Commissioner Levine Cava that the Board adopt the foregoing zoning application. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Sosa, and the floor was opened for discussion. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion would approve this applicant pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendation and would update two conditions as follows: 1.\tCondition #2 referencing a prior site plan - the site plan shown at todayï¿½s (04/26) meeting  was an updated version to the new site plan; and 2.\tCondition #6 referring to the traffic review section ï¿½ RER shall be a reference to applicable conditions and requirements of the Department of Transportation  and Public Works (DTPW) pursuant to the memorandum dated January 26, 2018. Pursuant to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question, Mr. Mayol explained the current land designation. Pursuant to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s inquiry, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel responded that the application was denied by the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB). There being no other comments or objections, the Board proceeded to take a vote on the foregoing application as amended. 4 181025 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-170 --  DISTRICT(S) 10  --  PZB 4, LLC.  --  REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM EU-S, SINGLE-FAMILY SUBURBAN ESTATE DISTRICT TO BU-1A, LIMITED BUSINESS DISTRICT ALONG WITH THE REQUESTS TO PERMIT A PROPOSED OFFICE BUILDING WITH MORE FLOOR AREA RATIO THAN REQUIRED BY CODE AND SETBACK LESS THAN REQUIRED BY THE PROPERTY LINE.

Suarez Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Jordan , District 5-Vacant , Martinez , Diaz REPORT: Assistant Director Nathan Kogon, Development Services Division, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests and no waivers. Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, counsel for Persea, LLC, Et Al, reminded the Board members that the application first came before the Board on April 26, 2018 and was deferred to today (5/31) to allow the applicant additional time to meet with the residents to explain the proposed changes and return with feedback from the residents. Mr. Mayol, with the aid of a map, identified the location of the subject parcel and explained the intent of the foregoing application. He advised the Board members that the property in question was located inside of the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) and was not designated for agricultural use but was instead included in the Master Plan for estate density.  Mr. Mayol summarized staffï¿½s recommendation and provided a brief overview of the zoning classifications found throughout the neighborhood, the proposed improvements to Avocado Road (SW 296th Street), the prevailing lot sizes in the area, zoning classifications for the City of Homestead and provided an example of the type of residential developments found in the area. Mr. Mayol explained the progression of the foregoing zoning application and the applicantï¿½s efforts to work with the community to clarify misconceptions regarding the development. He reviewed the difference between EU-M (Single Family Estate Modified Use) and EU-S (Single Family Estate Use Suburban) developments and noted the application sought to develop 51 EU-S homes on the property which included the 2 historic Krome residences located on the site; and requested a waiver of sidewalks and street lightning to preserve the neighborhoodï¿½s character.  Mr. Mayol pointed out that the revised application also proposed limiting the site plan to EUS development, decreased unit density while increasing the lot size, limited the number of driveways with access to Krome Avenue, provided landscape buffering next to the Tropical Audubon Society, agreed to provide improvements on 292nd Street, provided a dedicated right turn lane to facilitate access to Krome Avenue, and included a provision requiring the consent of the neighbors if anyone ever pursued an increase in density for this property. Mr. Mayol advised the Board members that the applicant had met with members of the community and had made every reasonable effort to address the concerns of the neighbors regarding the proposed development.  He reported in response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s request at the last meeting for the applicant to locate and research 30 acre parcels outside the UDB which could be preserved for agricultural usage in exchange for the rezoning of the subject property, the applicant had compiled a short list of properties but have found it financially unfeasible to purchase any of the listed properties because of the sales price.  Mr. Mayol stated through his research he had discovered an instance in which Application No. 8 from the May 2017 Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) Cycle had preserved agricultural land outside the UDB under similar conditions and noted the primary difference in the applications was the fact that the subject property in the foregoing application was located entirely within the UDB and was already zoned for estate density development.  Mr. Mayol spoke about the efforts made by the Krome family and the applicant to enhance preservation in the area and reviewed the use of severable use rights to transfer density inside the UDB while preserving land outside the UDB. Mr. Mayol reviewed the proposed declaration of restriction and argued that the revised application served as a compromise of the applicantï¿½s interests, the Krome familyï¿½s rights, the Countyï¿½s public policy and the concerns voiced by the community. Vice Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.\tMs. Patricia Malone, 29325 SW 202nd Avenue, Redland, Florida 2.\tMr. Jeff Blakley, 28590 SW 170th Avenue, Homestead, Florida 3.\tMr. David Torcise, 18001 SW 291st Street, Homestead, Florida 4.\tMr. Sidney Robinson, 23515 SW 162nd Avenue, Redland, Florida 5.\tMr. Mike Hatcher, 25145 SW 144th Avenue, Redland, Florida There being no other persons wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Mayol noted that both Mr. Blakley and Mr. Robinson agreed at the Community Council meeting that an EUS plan was an acceptable compromise and clarified that the proposed development was not high density as represented by Mr. Torcise.  He pointed out that the subject parcel was zoned for estate density inside the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) and reviewed the Boardï¿½s policy regarding agricultural land.  Mr. Mayol entered into the record a copy of an email message urging opposition to the application and argued that the application offered a reasonable compromise between the ownerï¿½s property rights and concerns of the neighbors; and requested the application be approved pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendations. Commissioner Levine Cava thanked Mr. Mayol for his presentation and for meeting with the neighbors regarding their concerns; and inquired whether the Krome family owned property that could be set aside to mitigate the loss of agricultural land. Mr. Mayol explained that the current cost of land would make the transaction unfeasible. Commissioner Levine Cava questioned whether the Krome family would consider retiring developmental rights on property they already owned to avoid the applicant having to purchase any additional land. Mr. Mayol noted that the Krome family was hesitant to set aside any more land given the familyï¿½s history and reiterated the subject parcel was located within the UDB and currently zoned for estate density development and as such would not result in the loss of agricultural land. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired if the Krome family was ever asked about the possibility of setting aside land they owned outside the UDB to mitigate the loss of agricultural land and whether there had been any communication with the family about lowering the price since the last time the application came before the Board on April 26, 2018. Mr. Larry Deddy, 8353 SW 124th Street, Miami, confirmed that the applicant had met with the Krome family on several occasions and had spoken with the familyï¿½s attorney after the last zoning meeting.  He advised the Board members that the family had in fact already reduced the initial purchase price but was unwilling to set aside any additional properties since the family had given away land to the County and designated properties as parks in the past.  Mr. Deddy added that the Krome family currently owned active farms outside the UDB and had no intention of developing those properties. Mr. Deddy disclosed that it had been recommended that the avocado grove located on the property be destroyed due to an infestation of avocado beetles and noted that there were high levels of copper in the soil which made the soil unsuitable for agricultural use.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to work with the community and stated that 95% of the community supported the proposed development. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Mayol regarding the availability of land located outside the UDB which could be earmarked for preservation as agricultural land. Commissioner Levine Cava reiterated her concerns regarding the loss of agricultural land and requested the application be deferred to allow the applicant additional time to meet with the Krome family to discuss whether they would accommodate the larger lot size as well set aside property for the long term agricultural use. There being no objection, the foregoing application was deferred to July 19, 2018 without re-advertisement.

Vice Chairwoman Edmonson advised her colleagues that she needed to leave the meeting at 2:00 pm. Commissioner Heyman pointed out that the Board had already implemented policy requiring the School Boardï¿½s input and presence at Zoning meetings whenever an application regarding a school was being considered and recommended improving upon the existing requirement rather than creating an entirely new procedure. Commissioner Heyman urged the School Board to be more consistent in providing reports and input moving forward. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Jordan and Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel regarding Commissioner Jordanï¿½s request for staff to revisit the inter local agreement and the ordinance governing the Boardï¿½s consideration of Charter School applications at Zoning hearings. Mr. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr LLP, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, JLK Four, LLC and provided a brief overview of the foregoing application, identifying the subject propertyï¿½s location and current zoning designation.  He noted that the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) allowed for the location of schools in all land use designations and zoning districts.  Mr. Diaz de la Portilla reviewed staffï¿½s recommendations and traffic service levels for the proposed site and submitted a petition of support with over 100 signatures into the record.

Following discussions among Chairman Bovo, Commissioner Sosa and Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel regarding speakersï¿½ providing their address on the record, Chairman Bovo requested all speakers on the foregoing item also indicate the proximity of their residence in relation to the subject property. Mr. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr LLP, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, Smart Charter Group LLC, and briefly reviewed the proposed property location for the expansion of the existing Charter school, highlighting surrounding properties and zoning designations.  He noted the subject property was once home to the Heritage School and now housed the current Grades K through 8 Charter school with a capacity for 600 students. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla noted the audience was filled with supporters of the item and spoke about the schoolï¿½s impact on the community and surrounding neighborhoods.  He explained the applicant was seeking a special exception to expand the school to accommodate 2,228 students from Grades K through 12 and to permit a non-use variance to permit the charter school with a building setback of 35 feet, less than the required 50 feet, from the interior side property line. Mr. Juan Carlos ï¿½J.Cï¿½ Quintana, SMART Management LLC, 7990 SW 117th Avenue, Miami, introduced himself to the Board members and spoke about BridgePrep Academyï¿½s history in the County highlighting BridgePrep Academy of Village Greenï¿½s diversity, unique curriculum and success.   He advised the Board members that the community was in dire need of a high school and noted there was already an extensive waiting list for admission into BridgePrep. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla concluded his presentation by reviewing the existing zoning designation for the subject property and staffï¿½s recommendations and findings.  Using a map, he explained the proposed zoning application and its traffic impact, including the applicantï¿½s plan for a gradual buildout and plans to improve traffic congestion; and submitted a petition of support for the expansion signed by over 1100 residents. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing zoning application: 1.\tMs. Katerine Campos, with the aid of an interpreter, 25008 SW 124th Court, Homestead FL 2.\tMs. Liney Toro, with the aid of an interpreter, 12314 SW 124th Path, Miami FL 3.\tMs. Jeniffer Abreu-Sinnes, 1001 SW 88th Court, Miami FL 4.\tMs. Mabel Junco, 11529 SW 124th Court, Miami FL 5.\tMs. Marisol Fernandez, 14671 SW 136th Place, Miami FL 6.\tMs. Eileen Maytin, 12969 SW 135th Street, Miami FL 7.\tMs. Jessica Bauer, 14912 SW 67th Lane, Miami FL 8.\tMs. Raquel B.

Mr. Weinstein requested the County Attorneyï¿½s Office review whether the subject property was located in a ï¿½no school zoneï¿½ and the zoning history for the site. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla objected to the Mr. Mossï¿½ testimony as a traffic expert/consultant citing the speakerï¿½s failure to comply with the Countyï¿½s rules related to expert testimony; and  requested any testimony proffered by Mr. Moss on the issue as an expert be stricken. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel read Section 33-311(D) of the County Code governing the process for admittance of expert testimony at public hearings into the record. Ms. Amina Newsome, Senior Division Chief for RER, confirmed that the department had not received a written summary of Mr. Mossï¿½ testimony. Chairman Bovo indicated that Mr. Mossï¿½ expert testimony would not be permitted or considered. There being no other persons wishing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla read a statement of support into the record from neighboring business-owner Ms. Jessica Modkin; 13301 SW 132nd Avenue, Miami. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla provided a brief summary of the foregoing application, highlighting departmental and staff recommendations.  He argued that the petition opposing the application was secured based on misinformation and spoke of the applicantï¿½s attempts to meet with the community to address the concerns. Chairman Bovo requested clarification regarding statements made by speakers referencing a ï¿½no school zoneï¿½. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that the ï¿½no school zoneï¿½ did not apply to existing facilities. Mr. Kogon confirmed pursuant to Florida Statute and the County Code, the schoolï¿½s expansion could not be prohibited but noted the department was able to evaluate the compatibility of the school and make recommendations based on the evaluation. Commissioner Moss requested clarification regarding the three shift module. Ms. Claudia Diaz, Division Chief for Miami-Dade Countyï¿½s Transportation and Public Works Department (DTPW), explained that the three shift component was a requirement in order to open the school and any changes would need Board approval. Commissioner Moss asked what was being done to verify the representations made by the applicant regarding the bus plan were credible and would be upheld. Mr. Kogon reported that the applicant was required to provide eight buses and renew the certificate of use annually.  He noted as a condition of the annual renewal the applicant would be required to prove that they were in compliance with the Florida Department of Transportationï¿½s (FDOT) Traffic Operation Plan (TOP) and confirmed that any changes to the TOP would have to be approved by the Board. Commissioner Moss inquired about the types of documents needed by staff to verify the applicant was adhering to the plan. Mr. Kogon advised the Board members that the applicant would be required to provide letters as well as any information requested by FDOT, including but not limited to studies and analyses, affidavits and evidence. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Moss and Mr. Kogon regarding the criteria for obtaining and renewing the certificate of use. Commissioner Moss expressed concern regarding the proposed capacity for the school and the inevitable traffic congestion which would result from the daily operation of the school despite the findings of the traffic study accompanying the application; and asked when was the last time the applicant met with the members of the community regarding the application. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla indicated that he last met with the residents on Tuesday (5/29) and met separately with Mr. Michael Rosenburg the week before. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla noted that the applicantï¿½s initial request was reduced from 3000 students to 2200 and explained how the schoolï¿½s capacity impacted special programs and the schoolï¿½s curriculum.  He pointed out that residents have been circulating a petition opposing the application since 2016 despite the applicantï¿½s attempts to work with staff to streamline the traffic plan. Commissioner Moss reiterated his concern regarding the proposed school capacity and asked about the minimum enrollment number needed to maintain the schoolï¿½s current program status. In response to Commissioner Mossï¿½ concern about the schoolï¿½s capacity, Chairman Bovo suggested his colleague consider implementing a ï¿½ramp upï¿½ approach which would gradually increase enrollment. Ms. Diaz clarified that while the application requested full enrollment based on the proposed improvements and traffic plan, there has been cases with other schools where the student body was increased in phases. Responding to Chairman Mossï¿½ earlier question about the minimum number of students needed to maintain the schoolï¿½s programs; Mr. Diaz de la Portilla advised the Board members that the critical number was 2000 students.  He confirmed that the new school would be completed over a period of three to five years in phases and revisited the certificate of use requirement delineated in the conditions of approval recommended by staff. Chairman Moss questioned why the ï¿½phasing inï¿½ component was not included in the application. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla discussed the inherent ï¿½phase inï¿½ aspect of constructing a new school, noting the applicant was not opposed to including ï¿½phase inï¿½ language in the application. Commissioner Moss asked whether it was possible at this juncture to include ï¿½phase inï¿½ language seeing that the application was already filed. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel indicated that a ï¿½phase inï¿½ component could be added as a special condition for approval of the application and deferred to staff for the specifics. Mr. Kogon explained an immediate approval of the application would require the applicant to complete the full buildout of all roadway infrastructures in the initial phase of construction.  He added if the applicant did not agree to a full buildout, staff would need time to review additional studies to phase in infrastructure. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla advised the Board members that the applicant had no objection to agreeing to a complete buildout of the roadway infrastructure in the initial phase of the construction. Commissioner Sosa commented that the charter school system received more state funds than public school so it was inaccurate to state the school was cost free.  She inquired about the teaching methods practiced in the existing school and asked if the school was equipped to meet the learning and physical needs of special needs students. Responding to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s questions, Ms. Patricia M. Garcia, Principal of BridgePrep Academy of Village Green, noted that the school employed the Socratic Method and have catered to special needs students since the schoolï¿½s opening. Discussions ensued between Commissioner Sosa and Ms. Garcia regarding the facilities available at the school and the type of testing completed by students. Commissioner Sosa requested clarification regarding statements made with regards to the site being approved for an aviation school. Mr. Kogon confirmed that the original school on the property was an aviation charter school but noted the existing school did not include an aviation component. Commissioner Sosa questioned the findings of the traffic impact study particularly in light of the requested capacity increase. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed concern regarding the number of students and traffic impact study findings.  She noted that many of the applications related to Commission District 9 also affects Commission District 8, as evidenced by the number of residents appearing in opposition of the application today. Mr. Kogon clarified that both staff and the traffic impact study recognized the impacts to the community and noted the study evaluated, adjudicated and identified the impact locations. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired about the current ï¿½level of serviceï¿½ rating for the streets in the area. Ms. Diaz indicated that the area received an ï¿½Eï¿½ rating during peak level of service.  She explained that the school currently had 600 students enrolled in one shift but the applicant proposed implementing three shifts with extra buses.  Ms. Diaz pointed out the staggered arrival and dismissal times maintain the level of service and reviewed the road infrastructure component of the application. Commissioner Levine Cava voiced concern regarding enforcement and inquired whether the impact of not staggering the students had been evaluated in the traffic study. Ms. Diaz advised the Board members that simply increasing the capacity without implementing a shift system would not work and noted the traffic study was completed by a consultant for the applicant. Commissioner Levine Cava pointed out that both Miami Sunset and Miami Killian Senior High Schools were within reasonable distance and under capacity.  She reviewed the number of vacancies at neighboring schools and suggested doubling the existing capacity at BridgePrep while maintaining the same grade structure. Commissioner Jordan inquired about the current enrollment at BridgePrep, including the number of students per classroom and total number of classrooms. Mr. Juan Carlos ï¿½J.Cï¿½ Quintana noted that the school was currently comprised of 37 classes and was required to adhere to the same criteria as public schools with a ratio of 18 students to one teacher for kindergarten classes through 3rd grade and 22 students to one teacher for grades 3 through 8.  He also clarified that the FCAT test had been replaced with the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA). Responding to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question about the proposed student enrollment increase, Mr. Quintana explained that the requested increase referenced kindergarten to high school and noted that the school needed at least 10 classes per grade level for proper articulation. Discussions ensued between Commissioner Jordan and Mr. Quintana regarding the requested capacity increase and the minimum number of students needed to maintain the schoolï¿½s current program status and expand into high school. Commissioner Monestime inquired about the age of the school. Mr. Quintana noted that the school opened seven years ago at another location and relocated to the current site three years ago. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla clarified that the subject site has been zoned for school use since 1979. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question regarding the growth of the school, Mr. Quintana reported that the school had grown approximately 300 percent over the last three years and noted that there were no high schools within a five mile radius. Commissioner Monestime asked how long it would take for the school to be completed and attain full capacity. Mr. Quintana reiterated the build out needed to be done in phases to accommodate the existing students and stated he anticipated all construction and student integration to be completed in four years. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Mr. Quintana regarding the projected annual increase in enrollment over the four year period. Chairman Bovo spoke about the traffic issues facing the County and proffered an example of a school that phased in students on a yearly basis grade by grade.  He stated that while he was not opposed to the expansion of the school, he was doubtful of the findings and recommendations included in the traffic study and suggested the applicant consider growing the school in phases. Commissioner Levine Cava suggested deferring the application to allow time for a new traffic study to determine the impact of not staggering shifts at the school. Responding to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question as to whether there were any children from the Richmond Heights area enrolled at the school, Ms. Garcia confirmed that there were a number of students from the area attending BridgePrep Academy Village Green and spoke of the schoolï¿½s outreach efforts. Commissioner Moss voiced concerns about the schoolï¿½s lack of diversity and the applicantï¿½s request for an increase of 2,228 students.  He stated while he was not opposed to the expansion of the school, traffic remained a major concern and proposed increasing the capacity to 1500 students in phases. Mr. Kogon revisited the options available to the applicant. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla requested the Board members consider increasing the capacity to 1800 students.  He indicated the applicant would accept the proffered increase to 1500 students if that was the only option. Commissioner Moss reiterated his concerns about traffic congestion in the area and indicated his support for increasing the capacity to 1500 students in phases. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Moss, Mr. Kogon and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel about the ï¿½phase inï¿½ schedule/timeframe. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla proffered an increase of 300 students per year over a five year period. Commissioner Moss requested guidance from the County Attorneyï¿½s Office as to how to proceed with the application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the Board members that the application should be approved as amended to allow for a maximum enrollment of 1500 students with a condition that the students be added incrementally. Mr. Kogon explained that an incremental increase of 300 students annually over a course of three years would bring the school to the proposed 1500 maximum student capacity. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla confirmed that the applicant accepted the proffered amendments to the application. Commissioner Moss noted that he was a staunch supporter of the public school system, hence his apprehension about the charter school system. Chairman Bovo commented on school safety and asked Assistant County Attorney Kerbel to clarify the motion before the Board. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reviewed the motion before the Board. Commissioner Sosa spoke about the cost of education and inquired whether the infrastructure build out component would still be required. Commissioner Moss confirmed that all traffic infrastructure improvements and buildout would be done in phase 1 of the expansion. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that the motion before the Board should be amended to include language requiring all traffic infrastructure improvements and buildout would be done in phase 1 of the expansion. Commissioner Moss pointed out that the proffered capacity increase of 1500 students was half the amount originally requested by the applicant. There being no further questions or comments, the Board, by motion duly made, seconded and carried, approved the application as modified to expand the schoolï¿½s maximum enrollment to 1500 students over a period of three years at a rate of 300 students per year; and to require all traffic infrastructure improvements and buildout be completed during Phase 1 of the expansion. Commissioner Jordan requested the Miami-Dade County Public School Board provide a report detailing charter schoolsï¿½ enrollment and diversity figures and argued that charter schools should be required to serve students in the ï¿½feeder patternï¿½ much like public schools to ensure diversity. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out that a member of the Miami-Dade School Board was present and could provide some of the information requested by Commissioner Jordan and noted that State law allowed charter schools to give priority to enrollees within an attendance boundary. Commissioner Jordan reiterated her request for the report. Commissioner Sosa requested all future requests for charter school expansions include a report from the Miami-Dade School Board detailing the capacity of surrounding schools. Commissioner Jordan requested clarification regarding the role of the School Board in processing charter school application requests. Commissioner Moss asked whether there was an avenue for developing standards and/or guidelines to help govern the Boardï¿½s decisions regarding the approval of charter school applications. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that the Board had an inter-local agreement with the School Board pertaining to how charter school applications were processed and suggested it may be time to refresh the inter-local agreement to address the Boardï¿½s concerns to provide a comprehensive review of existing regulations to better account for the communityï¿½s needs in addition to the infrastructure and public service and facilities impacts considered for zoning matters. Commissioner Jordan requested the County Attorneyï¿½s Office prepare a legislative item to review the inter-local agreement between the Board and the Miami-Dade School Board related to the processing of charter school requests. Commissioners Levine Cava, Moss, Sosa, Edmonson and Monestime requested to be added as co-sponsors on the item. 2 181375 Zoning HEARING NO. Z2017000361  --  DISTRICT(S) 10  -- JACK J.

ZONING ITEM(S) PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED: A 181090 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-030  --  DISTRICT(S) 02  --  NATURAL PROPERTIES SERVICE, LLC.  --  REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICATION IS TO AMEND THE LAND USE REGULATING PLAN OF THE NCUAD FOR THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM MC, MIXED-USE CORRIDOR TO MCS, MIXED-USE CORRIDOR SPECIAL.  --  LOCATION: 9660 NW 27 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.  WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-8-18 Mover: Jean Monestime Seconder: Daniella Levine Cava Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Jordan , Edmonson , District 5-Vacant , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Carlos Manrique, 23 NW 136 Place, attorney representing the applicant, noted the applicant was requesting approval to change the property designation from MC (mixed-use corridor) to MCS (mixed-use corridor special) and explained the subject property was previously zoned BU2 with a use variance to allow vehicle repair; however, during the Charrette process in 2012, the County changed the propertyï¿½s zoning designation to MC due to long term inactivity on the site.  He pointed out the subject property was a small lot located on NW 27th Avenue, directly on the Transit Corridor, and the surrounding area was characterized by small auto dealerships.  Mr. Manrique urged the Boardï¿½s approval of the application noting the applicant was committed to adhering to standard urban center design specifications, intended to aesthetically improve the site, and would dedicate a portion of the property to enhance the right turn onto NW 97 Street. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing and called for persons wishing to speak on this item.  There being no persons appearing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Mr. Nathan Kogon explained, in order for the application to be consistent with mass transit corridor uses, the property would have to be brought up to code and have a mixed-use designation.  He also pointed out the intent of the urban center was to promote a high-intensity mixed use that was transit supportive and the applicantï¿½s request deviated from that concept. Commissioner Monestime expressed concern with the blighted appearance along NW 27th Avenue due to the number of used car lots located there and supported staffs recommendation to deny the application without prejudice. Mr. Manrique argued, due to the small size of the property, no uses applicable to the North Central Urban Area District (NCUAD) designation could be applied; and opined the County would have grandfathered the zoning designation and not changed it, if the property had not been in bankruptcy during the Charrette process.  He also indicated he had letters from area residents and businesses in support of the proposed application. A discussion ensued regarding the subject propertyï¿½s zoning designation change that occurred in during the Charrette process along the NW 27th Avenue transit corridor in 2012.  It was noted small improvements along the corridor were being made; that other sites along the corridor were grandfathered with an MCS designation; that auto oriented uses were specifically targeted to be reduced along the corridors; and that the application was incompatible with the future vision of the area, not the existing conditions. Commissioner Martinez expressed concern with the County taking away property rights and the property owner deciding to leave an abandoned building on the subject site, thereby contributing to the blight in the area.  He noted he would support the district commissionerï¿½s decision; however, understood if the applicant chose to do nothing on the property. Mr. Kogon explained the applicant had uses, such as an office building and residential, under the NCUAD zoning requirements. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel clarified, the applicant had rights and was asking for additional rights; and the County was not infringing on the property ownerï¿½s rights. Chairman Bovo concurred with Commissioner Martinezï¿½s comments noting some sites in the subject area would remain in their current state due to land owners being unable to afford to do anything with their property.  He suggested the foregoing application be deferred to allow the applicant to meet with staff to gain a better perspective of what the Countyï¿½s vision for that corridor was. There being no further comments or questions, the Board, by motion duly made, seconded and carried, denied the application without prejudice. 5/3/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B 181509 Zoning HEARING NO. 17-267 -- DISTRICT(S) 10 -- AUTOZONE STORES, LLC. -- REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR A 5' HIGH MASONRY WALL WHERE A BUSINESS LOT ABUTS A RESIDENTIAL ZONED DISTRICT AND TO PERMIT INSTEAD A 5ï¿½ HIGH CHAIN LINK FENCE ALONG THE ABUTTING PROPERTY LINE. -- LOCATION: LYING EAST OF SW 117 AVENUE, BETWEEN SW 84 STREET AND SW   117 AVENUE ROAD, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

Attorney Juan Mayol on behalf of the applicant noted that the item had been deferred to allow him to meet with neighbors; he was here to report on the changes made as a result of the meeting with neighbors. With regards to Chairman Bovoï¿½s inquiry regarding whether to open the public hearing or not, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel explained that Chairman Bovo could open the public hearing to allow comments on the new material and changes that Mr. Mayol was introducing into the record. Mr. Mayol noted that this application was deferred in an effort to meet with neighbors of the subject property.  He and the applicant met with the neighbors on April 26, 2018. He explained this application seeks rezoning to B1A, proposed to limit the use to office only.  Mr. Mayol displayed a large photograph rendering of the elevation of the building being proposed back in April; he noted in the meeting he explained why the building had to be two stories on top of a parking area.  Mr. Mayol further explained that the building had to be on top of a parking access area to allow fire trucks as well garbage trucks to drive onto the property, circulate and to drive out.  He also noted that by placing the building on Miller Drive, a busy road, with a 25 foot setback, it allowed traffic to enter and exit.  Mr. Mayol presented more photographs of the subject property and continued his presentation and noted the following changes: to lower the building to 40 feet, reduction of the size of the building, eliminated the variance of setback and open space; added a green wall on the rear south facing wall, eliminated the windows on the rear south facing portion of the building and a substantial increase to the landscaping along the southern property line of the building.

Ms. Quintana noted that they did not come to any agreement regarding the applicant lowering some aesthetic from the top of the building; she asked the Board to take the residentï¿½s privacy into consideration.  She suggested a different type of building be used on the property and that there was three more vacant lots in the area and residents were afraid more tall buildings would be allowed if this application was approved. Mr. Alessandro Quintana, 9965 SW 58th Street Miami, Florida noted his concerns regarding the height of the building and spoke against the foregoing application. After hearing no one else wishing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Replying to Commissioner Soutoï¿½s inquiry regarding whether the applicant had complied with or addressed the concerns of the residents, Mr. Kogon noted the primary concern were windows on the rear of structure that would overlook residential properties and that the applicants had tried to address the residentï¿½s concerns.  The applicant had lowered the height of the building and added more landscaping. Commissioner Souto commented on the removal of the parking to under the building due to the complaints from neighbors regarding the height With regards to Commissioner Soutoï¿½s inquiry regarding parking under the building, Mr. Kogon explained that the original application had surface parking under the building; they chose to meet the parking requirements and not request a variance.  In order for that site to work they needed that surface area under the building, in addition staff requested them to push building close to Miller and to move it as far away from the residentï¿½s homes as possible. Commissioner Souto noted that after listening to staff he would move to follow the recommendation of staff and approve the application. Commissioner Diaz seconded the motion. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified for the record and noted that with the revised application the applicant said they would withdraw request number 2 and number 4; and modify request number 3 to approve a variance to a floor area ratio of .64; which was now staffï¿½s recommendation with the amendments, and with the proffered covenants. Mr. Kogan noted also with a modification of the plan description which was item 2 to the new plan dated July 13, 2018.

Commissioner Moss expressed his concern regarding the number of Charter Schools coming before the Board of County Commissioners for approval, particularly in his district.  He noted that he was concerned that the schools in his district that were in challenged neighborhoods, some of these schools were repurposed or under threat of closure due to low enrollment.  Commissioner Moss explained that the County had an interlocal agreement with the School Board and they had not been providing the County with information required under that interlocal agreement so that the County can make better and more informed decisions.  He pointed out that charter schools were public schools just like regular public schools, however regular public schools did not come through the Board and were administered through the School Board, he felt that Charter schools should be administered through the School Board as well because the Board has not been provided any information regarding the impact of these charter schools. Mr. Kogan noted that the item should be deferred with leave to amend. There being no objection, the foregoing application was deferred to October 25, 2018.

It was decided that the Zoning meeting would be held first on the Agenda and then commence with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan meeting. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced that the Special Zoning meeting scheduled for Wednesday, October 3, 2018 was limited to the specific items on the call for that meeting.

Commissioner Levine Cava asked Mr. Mayol to comment on the deferral request and his comment that individuals were advised not to attend todayï¿½s (9/27) meeting. Mr. Mayol indicated that he was informed by staff several weeks ago that the Zoning items on todayï¿½s (9/27) agenda were going to be considered on October 3, 2018 because of todayï¿½s lengthy discussion on the I-836 extension.  He said that individuals from the community supporting this proposal were notified of this change and did not appear. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed concern that Mr. Mayol knew of the change before she did and that she did not have the opportunity to inform people about the change.  She said it was an inconvenience for individuals who took the time to attend this meeting and were not aware of the change.  Commissioner Levine Cava said she would like to discuss an improved notification process with staff. Chairman Bovo mentioned previous instances where people could still testify even though the item was deferred. Mr. Willie Abascal, 24540 SW 122 Avenue, Miami, stated that he was opposed to the project and suggested the item be deferred until January, 2019 to allow sufficient time for proper notification. Discussion ensued over the process of scheduling a mutually agreeable date to consider this item to which it was decided would be December 6, 2018. All speakers who appeared before the Board were advised they would have the opportunity to speak today (9/27); however, if they did so, they would not speak again when the item was heard on December 6, 2018.

Martinez Vote: 12 - 0 Absent: Suarez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Regulatory & Economic Resources Department, read the foregoing proposed item into the record. Ms. Lynn Dannheisser, 3152 Gifford Lane, Miami, appeared before the Board representing T & O Enterprise, Inc.  She described the subject property, noting the request from residential to mixed use corridor was conducive with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan with intensity increasing over the past two years.  Ms. Dannheisser said that the request added general retail and office use; that there would be overflow parking added to an already approved project; and that there would be no overflow into residential areas.  She mentioned that commercial development was oriented toward NE 25th Avenue and residential properties were oriented toward NE 184th Terrace.  Ms. Dannheisser requested a favorable consideration and submitted 97 petitions of support into the record. Mr. Robert Cooper, representing Ms. Lenore Diaz, 18450 NE 25 Court, Miami, stated Ms. Diaz was a property owner across the street from the subject location.  He said that the commercial properties were on Miami Gardens Drive; however, this property did not adjoin that street.  Mr. Cooper indicated that this would increase traffic, street parking and change the character of the neighborhood by adding retail into a residential neighborhood. Ms. Anat Cooper, appeared before the Board representing Arch MB LLC, 2510-52 NE 184 Terrace, Miami, noting she managed 16 townhomes on NE 184 Terrace.  She spoke in opposition because of the impact business development would bring to a family oriented neighborhood. Ms. Dannheisser pointed out that the property was already designated MC and the line was drawn.  She said staff recommendation found no negative impact to the multi-family residential area. Commissioner Heyman pointed out that Miami Gardens Drive was a through street serving Aventura, Sunny Isles Beach, Golden Beach and other communities.  She said this request was respectful of the residential character of the neighborhood, noting they only asked for townhouses and not high rise buildings.  Commissioner Heyman stated that the applicant was committed to keeping traffic out of the residential area during construction.  She added that the application further buffered an existing residential area from business encroachment. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to approve staffï¿½s recommendation. 7/19/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners ADJOURNMENT REPORT: There being no further business, the Zoning meeting adjourned at 10:57 a.m. 3 CONSENT AGENDA 9/25/2024 Agenda Key: 4158 Home | Agendas | Minutes | Legislative Search | Lobbyist Registration | Legislative Reports 2024 BCC Meeting Calendar | Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances | ADA Notice | Home | Using Our Site | About | Phone\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDirectory | Privacy | Disclaimer E-mail your comments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions and suggestions to Webmaster Web Site\r\n\t\t\t\t\tï¿½ 2024 Miami-Dade County.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-16-18 Mover: Daniella Levine Cava Seconder: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Vote: 12 - 1 No: Suarez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 341 protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, counsel for Persea, LLC, Et Al, briefly reviewed the history of the item, noting the application had been deferred a number of times.  He noted the item was deferred on May 31, 2018 to allow the applicant additional time to identify land located outside the UDB which could be earmarked for preservation as agricultural land. Mr. Mayol advised the Board members that the property size was approximately 27 acres and was located inside of the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) designated in the Master Plan for estate density.  He pointed out the applicantï¿½s modified request for EU-S (Single Family Estate Use Suburban) district boundary change was consistent with the current designation and was recommended by staff for approval.  Mr. Mayol added the application had been reviewed by eight different agencies and departments with no objections to the proposals. Mr. Mayol stated despite the fact that the request met all the conditions for approval, the applicant was prepared to support Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s conservation efforts and had revised the declaration of restrictions to reflect the applicant, prior to the approval of a final plot, would proffer a covenant to designate property outside of the UDB for agricultural uses for perpetuity. Mr. Mayol proceeded to explain the terms and execution of the covenant. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1. Ms. Patricia Malone, 29325 SW 202nd Avenue, Redland 2. Mr. Jeff Blakley, 28590 SW 170th Avenue, Homestead 3. Mr. David Torcise, 18001 SW 291st Street, Homestead There being no other persons wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Responding to comments made by Ms. Malone regarding the Community Councilï¿½s (CC) unanimous denial of the application, Mr. Mayol argued that a misleading Facebook post alleging 67 home sites could be converted to townhomes, duplexes, twin homes or affordable housing; contributed to the amount of protests filed and influenced the Community Councilï¿½s decision to deny the application.  He noted the applicant had been diligent in meeting with the community and reported the majority of the community supported a compromise which protected the ownerï¿½s property rights and addressed conservation. Mr. Mayol explained the revised application proposed limiting the site plan to EU-S development and noted the average lot sizes would exceed 24,000 square feet.  He stated the application sought to develop 51 EU-S homes on the property which included the 2 historic Krome residences located on the site and reported the applicant, in the spirit of compromise, was prepared to expand the property surrounding the historic homes to 1 acre and agreed to create a landscape buffer next to the Tropical Audubon Society, request a waiver of sidewalks and street lightning to preserve the neighborhoodï¿½s character, provide improvements on 292nd Street, provide a dedicated right turn lane to facilitate access to Krome Avenue and preserve land outside the UDB for conservation. Mr. Mayol spoke about the Boardï¿½s role in zoning matters and requested the application be approved pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendations. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s questions as to how the original application differed from the revised application, Mr. Mayol explained the original application requested zoning for EU-M (Single Family Estate Modified Use) and proposed developing 67 homes with no site plan while the revised application sought EU-S zoning to develop 49 new homes. He reviewed the difference between EU-M and EU-S developments and stressed the EU-S plan was formulated as a compromise with the residents. Commissioner Levine Cava commented on the complexity of the application and spoke about the importance of preserving agricultural land.  She recognized the applicantï¿½s efforts to compromise and voiced her support for the item given the revised declaration of restriction and proffered covenant. Commissioner Levine Cava requested clarification regarding the motion before the Board. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion would grant the appeal and staffï¿½s recommendations for: 1.\tModified approval for Request No. 1 (District Boundary Change from AU to EU-S) subject to acceptance of the proffered covenant; 2.\tApproval with conditions of Request No. 2; 3.\tModified approval with conditions of Request No. 3. Commissioner Levine Cava spoke about her commitment to preserving agricultural land and her plans to work alongside the Planning Department to create and implement policy to that effect. Commissioner Suarez spoke about the role of the CC and stated he could not support the application based on the CCï¿½s unanimous denial. Commissioner Sosa questioned the applicantï¿½s request to waive regulations requiring sidewalks and street lightning. Mr. Mayol explained the waiver sought to maintain the neighborhoodï¿½s rural character since many of the area streets did not include lights or sidewalks. Commissioner Sosa commented on the proposed improvements to SW 292nd Street and inquired about the term of the declarations of restrictions. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel indicated the declaration of restrictions was binding for a period of thirty years with automatic renewal in ten year increments and noted any changes to the covenant needed the Boardï¿½s approval.  He pointed out future sale of the property was also subject to the conditions of the covenant. Commissioner Sosa voiced her support for the item. Commissioner Jordan voiced her concerns about preserving dwindling agricultural land and requested clarification regarding the ï¿½set asideï¿½ provision. Mr. Mayol reassured the Board members that the ï¿½set asideï¿½ land would be no less than ten acres and noted the applicant had already identified the property and was awaiting staffï¿½s approval. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Jordan, Mr. Mayol and Mr. Kogon regarding the ï¿½set asideï¿½ property and covenant. There being no other comments or objections, the Board proceeded to vote on the foregoing application as amended. 5/31/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 7/19/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 9/27/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B. 181778 Zoning HEARING NO: Z2017000274  --  DISTRICT(S): 08  --  11990 SILVER PALM, LLC.  --  REQUEST(S): - THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO ALLOW A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM AU, AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT, TO RU-1M(B), SINGLE-FAMILY MODIFIED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t November 15, 2018 Zoning Z-24-18 Mover: Daniella Levine Cava Seconder: Barbara J. Jordan Vote: 12 - 0 Absent: Suarez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were fourteen protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Javier Fernandez, Berger Singerman LLP, 1450 Brickell Avenue, counsel for 11990 Silver Palm, LLC. introduced the foregoing application.  He explained the item appealed the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s (CZAB) denial of the applicantï¿½s request for a district boundary change and variance.  Mr. Fernandez noted the subject property was currently designated Estate Density Residential and reviewed the propertyï¿½s location.  He told the Board members the applicant requested (1) a District Boundary change from an Agricultural District (AU) to Modified Single Family (RU-1Mb) and had proffered a covenant to ensure the density was consistent with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP); and (2) a non-use variance to clarify a discrepancy between the Public Works manual and the zoning code regarding the required dedication. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.\tMs. Sandra Foertsch, 23403 SW 120th Avenue, Princeton 2.\tMs. Marilyn Rolfs, 24371 SW 123rd Avenue, Princeton 3.\tMr. Michael Angelo Byrd, 22602 SW 128th Place, Miami 4.\tMr. Osmond Commock, 12751 SW 226th Street, Miami The following persons appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing zoning application: 1.\tMs. Candida Torralvo, 11830 SW 235th Street, Homestead 2.\tMs. Luisa Montes, 11717 SW 238th Street, Homestead 3.\tMs. Ana M. Castunela (through interpreter), 11769 SW 238th Street, Homestead 4.\tMs. Marjory Camacho (through interpreter), 11830 SW 235th Street, Homestead 5.\tMs. Yeimy Diaz, (through interpreter), 11743 SW 237th Avenue, Homestead 6.\tMs. Marliny Buritica, (through interpreter), 11433 SW 253th Street, Homestead There being no other persons wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Using a map, Mr. Fernandez reviewed the size of neighboring lots noting the proposed development maintained the neighborhood character and submitted a petition of support containing 56 signatures into the record.  He argued the proposed development would help salvage the natural forest through the creation of a special taxing district to finance the Countyï¿½s Department of Environmental Resources Managementï¿½s (DERM) ongoing maintenance and preservation efforts. Mr. Fernandez reviewed staffï¿½s findings and recommendations pertaining to the proposed lot size and traffic impacts.  He advised the Board the applicant was prepared to work with neighbors and the County to implement traffic mitigation measures along SW 232nd Street. Mr. Fernandez urged the Board members to consider staffï¿½s recommendation and approve the applicantï¿½s request for a reversal of the CZABï¿½s denial of the application. Commissioner Levine Cava spoke about the lack of property maintenance leading to the degradation of the pine rock land and argued development of the land was not the solution to the problem. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Kogon regarding staffï¿½s recommendation as it pertained to the applicantï¿½s district boundary change request. Mr. Kogon reviewed staffï¿½s recommendations and pointed out the proposed development was in keeping with the density threshold for estate density given the proposed site plan and proposed covenant limiting the development to 19 units.  He stated while the gross residential density included the natural forest area, the applicant would not be permitted to develop the entire area. Commissioner Levine Cava requested the item be deferred to allow for further discussions with DERM as to why the applicant was allowed to develop 20% of the natural forest area and reiterated her concerns that development would further degrade the natural forest area. Mr. Fernandez noted the applicant recently purchased the property which was already damaged due to neglect from the previous owners and explained the 20% area earmarked for development was degraded beyond salvageability. Commissioner Levine Cava pointed out the application did not incorporate any elements to protect the natural forest area and restated her concerns regarding the development of the property and her desire to hear from DERM. Mr. Fernandez noted the property needed to be divided and spoke about the applicantï¿½s intent to create a companion special taxing district and covenant to provide the necessary protections during the platting process. Commissioner Levine Cava moved to defer the foregoing item to the November 15, 2018 Zoning meeting.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan. Commissioner Moss commented on the property size east of SW 119th Avenue and asked whether those lot sizes were considered when developing the site plan for the subject property. Mr. Kogon explained the larger lots were approved in the past because there was less development in the area and noted staff believed a RU-1Mb development was acceptable. Responding to Commissioner Diazï¿½ question regarding the testimony at todayï¿½s (10/3) hearing, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated since the public hearing was closed, the Board was not required to reopen the public hearing when next the item was considered. Commissioner Jordan requested clarification regarding the platting process. Mr. Kogon reviewed the platting process and explained the applicant would be required to identify the natural forest community (NFC) and commence preservation and maintenance in accordance to DERMï¿½s requirements for the area. Commissioner Jordan asked whether the NFC was already protected. Mr. Kogon stated while the NFC may have been previously identified the platting process reiterated the areaï¿½s protections and deferred to DERM for clarification. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Jordan and Mr. Kogon regarding the 20% earmarked for development. Mr. Kogon pointed out Section 24-49 of the Code allowed up to 20% of the NFC to be developed subject to specific criteria. Commissioner Jordan questioned whether there were maintenance requirements for NFCs, once an area was identified and designated as such. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed there were specific maintenance regulations for NFCs and deferred to DERM for more information. Commissioner Levine Cava urged the applicant to meet with the neighbors south of the subject area regarding their concerns and spoke about the value of the property.  She also asked the applicant to consider a less dense development. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to defer the item until November 15, 2018.

Souto Seconder: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Vote: 10 - 1 No: Martinez Absent: Jordan , Cava REPORT: Chairman Bovo noted there was a large number of speakers present for todayï¿½s (10/3) meeting and suggested each side (supporters and opposition) select a representative to speak on behalf of the group to help save time and eliminate repetitive testimony. Discussion ensued among Chairman Bovo, Mr. Hugo Arza (attorney for the applicant Jack J. Tierney) and Mr. Tucker Gibbs (attorney representing the residents opposing the application) regarding the number of speakers to appear before the Board and agreed that 12 representatives from each side should speak. Commissioner Sosa requested the speakers who lived in proximity of the subject area to stand in order to determine the balance of both groups. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 667 protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Hugo Arza, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, counsel for Jack J. Tierney appeared before the Board and introduced the projectï¿½s stakeholders.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to meet with residents in the spirit of compromise and emphasized the need for the charter school in the area (True North Classical Academy) citing a wait list exceeding 800 students. Mr. Arza identified the location of the subject area on an aerial map and noted the property was located on an ideal lot of land and next to an arterial roadway perfect for accommodating growing infrastructure and development. Mr. Michael Bileca, 9130 SW 100th Street, Miami spoke about the vision for the school and efforts made to meet with residents opposing the application.  He noted the community was concerned about the number of schools in the area and preserving ï¿½Horse Countryï¿½ and argued True North Classical Academy would actually benefit the community because of its strategic partnerships with agricultural science programs.  Mr. Bileca reported the school was in the process of developing partnerships with the University of Florida (UF) and Florida International University (FIU) to create an agricultural research center in the community which would help preserve the areaï¿½s unique lifestyle. Mr. Arza reiterated the benefits of the school and spoke about parentsï¿½ choice to choose.  He reviewed staffï¿½s recommendations and highlighted the extensive evaluation process undergone by the application, including the traffic mitigation measures incorporated in the schoolï¿½s designs. Mr. Rolando Yanez, Principal of Civic Governor Architectural Firm, 8323 NW 12th Street, Doral, described the buildingsï¿½ multi-faceted design and practical components of the site plan including the court yard.  He pointed out the school had 2800 lineal feet of onsite queuing which along with the two shift system would help alleviate some of the traffic concerns raised by the residents. Mr. Arza introduced letters from FIU and UF pledging commitment to work with True North in the development of agricultural and horticultural programs.  He noted the waiting list for this tuition free public school included families from the community along with those on the outskirts of Horse Country and urged the Board members to approve the foregoing application pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendations. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Coconut Grove, appeared on behalf of Horse Country Miami, Inc., and residents Paola Queipo (5991 SW 118th Avenue) and William Perez (5909 SW 118th Avenue) to request the Board deny the foregoing application.  He argued the proposed mega school was unnecessary and incompatible with the Horse Country agricultural community and failed to meet the Countyï¿½s Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) regulations requiring the uses compatibility with agriculture and the rural residential character of the area within the agricultural land use designation.  Mr. Gibbs stated approval of the application would lead to excessive traffic, and an overcrowded concentration of people that was contrary to the zoning code. He also noted the application did not meet the zoning code requirements and was unnecessary and unreasonable to the present and future development of the Horse Country area. Mr. Gibbs critiqued the short comings of the traffic study and the Countyï¿½s traffic report; and contended the application failed to comply with various zoning and CDMP requirements which warranted a denial. Mr. Ernie Thomas, 6050 SW 120 Avenue, President of Horse Country Miami Inc., and resident in close proximity of the proposed site, stated the primary objection to the application was related to the location of the school and not the school itself.  He urged the Board members to consider the land use, rural community and the long-term caretakers of the land who fought to preserve and maintain the area.  Mr. Thomas noted there were already seven private schools and four charter schools located in the area and pointed out there was a pending application for an additional 1,000 students at True North Classical Academyï¿½s Sunset location. Mr. Thomas published a video showing traffic during morning drop-off between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and submitted a petition containing 2,413 signatures of residentsï¿½ opposition of the application. After a brief break, Assistant County Dennis Kerbel reminded the County Commissioners they had to listen to the entire meeting in order to vote on the application. Commissioner Sosa asked speakers to state their proximity to the subject site. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing application: 1.\tMr. Marc Snyder, 12509 SW 124th Terrace, Miami 2.\tMr. Jorge Finlay, 15382 SW 92nd Street, Miami 3.\tMs. Monica Cuenca, 13011 SW 182nd Terrace, Miami 4.\tMs. Dana Pezoldt, 17903 SW 87th Place, Palmetto Bay 5.\tMr. David McCloud, 6465 SW 95th Avenue, Miami 6.\tMs. Jessica Gomez, 6555 SW 94th Avenue, Miami 7.\tMr. Shane Connolly, 11850 SW 30th Street, Miami 8.\tMs. Cynthia Demos, 14441 SW 80th Street, Palmetto Bay 9.\tMr. Chris Claflin, 6415 SW 82nd Street, Miami 10.\tMs. Gladys Amato, 13100 SW 82nd Terrace, Winston Park 11.\tMr. John Chester, 3914 NE 20th Circle, Homestead 12.\tMr. Dennis Locke, 8420 SW 48th Street, Miami The following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.\tMs. Barbara Lopez, 5800 SW 123 Avenue, Miami and owner of 15 adjoining acres of property in the proximity of the subject property. 2.\tMs. Paola Querpo, 5991 SW 118th Avenue, Miami 3.\tMs. Michelle Sebree, 6150 SW 120th Avenue, Miami 4.\tMs. Guillermina Palomares (with the aid of an interpreter), 5707 SW 118th Avenue, Miami 5.\tMr. Humberto Triana, 6211 SW 116th Place, Miami 6.\tMr. Tom Worrell, 6200 SW 125th Avenue, Miami 7.\tMr. William Thomson, 10451 SW 47th Street, Miami 8.\tMr. Marcus Mortensen, 10501 SW 45th Street, Miami 9.\tMr. Michael Gast, 5801 SW 120th Avenue, Miami 10.\tMr. Michael Rosenberg, 13030 North Calusa Club Drive, Miami 11.\tMs. Ileana Petisco, 14590 SW 179th Avenue, Miami There being no other persons wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Addressing comments made by residents opposing the application, Mr.  Arza pointed out that traffic congestion was not unique to Horse Country.  He noted pursuant to the goals, objectives and policies under the ï¿½Institutions, Utilities and Communicationsï¿½ text of the CDMP ï¿½public and private schools may be approved, where compatible, in all urban land use categories, including agriculture, inside the Urban Development Boundary (UDB).ï¿½  Mr. Arza spoke about the number of schools located in the area and reiterated True North Classical Academyï¿½s pledge and commitment to develop an agricultural program and research center. Acknowledging the concerns voiced by the residents, Commissioner Souto proffered the following ideas for the applicant to consider: ~\tOpen the school with a reduced student count with the ability to increase capacity by 100 students annually; ~\tBoard review of the school every 2 years with a maximum buildout and capacity to be determined by the Board; ~\tProhibit cars on the school compound; ~\tImplement a bus system for transporting students to school; ~\tCreate a central location away from the school where students can be dropped off by their parents and bused to the school. Commissioner Suarez concurred with the suggestions made by Commissioner Souto regarding the implementation of an external central pick-up and drop-off point and suggested maintaining the current lot coverage restriction at 15% while reducing the size of the linear driveway. Commissioner Heyman recognized the merits of both sidesï¿½ arguments.  She stated while she supported the expansion of the school she could not support the application based on the proposed location. Commissioner Sosa requested clarification regarding the applicantï¿½s request. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated the applicant requested a special exception to permit a Charter School, kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12). Commissioner Sosa noted there were 25 traditional public schools and 10 charter schools located in the area and reported 19 out of the 25 traditional public schools had additional capacity.  She expressed concerns regarding the proposed location and the traffic impact on the community and suggested the applicant find another location. Commissioner Martinez requested clarification as to whether the proposed site would serve as an expansion of the existing True North Classical Academy located on Sunset Drive or was an entirely new school. Mr. Arza stated the current school went up to grade 8 with no ability to expand, thus the applicantï¿½s request for the new K-12 school, and spoke about the applicantï¿½s intent to first build the high school at the proposed site. Commissioner Martinez commented on Commissioner Soutoï¿½s suggestion to limit the student capacity and require students be bused to the school campus. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Martinez and Mr. Arza regarding the challenges of expanding the existing school as opposed to building the new school. Commissioner Martinez spoke about the inevitable impact the proposed school would have on ï¿½Horse Country.ï¿½ Commissioner Levine Cava stated the issue before the Board was a zoning matter and not about education.  She noted she could not support the application based on traffic, compatibility and necessity issues and suggested the applicant pursue alternative solutions such as expanding the current location to accommodate a high school. Commissioner Diaz indicated his intent to support the District Commissionerï¿½s decision and recognized the benefits of the lineal driveway included in the schoolï¿½s design in alleviating traffic during pick-up and drop-off times. Commissioner Monestime questioned the basis for staffï¿½s recommendation to approve. Mr. Kogon explained that staffï¿½s recommendations were based on several factors including the traffic analysis performed on the area and proceeded to review the process. Commissioner Monestime asked what other factors were taken into consideration other than traffic. Mr. Kogon stated the structureï¿½s massing, orientation and buffering were also reviewed. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question as to whether need for capacity was a deciding factor, Mr. Kogon explained that while the data was included in the application it was not considered by staff since it was not included in the CDMP or zoning analysis provided to staff for review. Commissioner Monestime voiced concerns about the review process. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified while the zoning code for special exception requests state that the Board ï¿½can consider the necessity for and reasonableness of such applied for exception or useï¿½, the issue of was not one that staff could prioritize given the context.  He pointed out that charter schools were governed by the Florida Statutes which provides for both need and choice, making the Boardï¿½s decision difficult.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained why school capacity/need was considered for residential development applications but not for new school requests. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding need for choice. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reiterated the issue before the Board was a zoning matter and noted the quality of the school was not a deciding factor. He pointed out that while the County did not control charter schoolsï¿½ curriculums, the application before the Board presented a unique opportunity for the Board to determine compatibility given the agricultural component of the program. Commissioner Monestime spoke about the importance of safeguarding residentsï¿½ interests given the unique characteristics of the community and urged the parties to consider the suggestions offered by Commissioner Souto. Commissioner Higgins stated she could not support the application based on the number of schools with vacancies in the area and the Boardï¿½s commitment to mitigate traffic in areas impacted by the recently approved Kendall Expressway. Chairman Bovo discussed the possibility of changing school hours to help alleviate traffic.  He noted many of the schools with available capacity were not located in close vicinity to the subject site and spoke about parentsï¿½ choice.  Chairman Bovo reiterated the issue before the Board was a zoning matter and stated he would support the District Commissionerï¿½s decision and suggested the applicant revisit the school hours and number of students. Commissioner Sosa spoke about classroom sizes and stated the existing schoolï¿½s application for expansion should be resolved before considering the foregoing application. Responding to Commissioner Soutoï¿½s request for a status update on the application for expansion at the Sunset location, Mr. Arza insisted both schools were needed based on the wait list. Commissioner Souto reiterated the Boardï¿½s concerns that there were two pending applications from applicant and asked the applicant to choose which application they would prefer to proceed on. Mr. Arza highlighted the importance of the subject site in Horse Country for the continued growth of the school. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Souto and Mr. Arza regarding the applicantï¿½s willingness to accept the proffered suggestions. Commissioner Souto proffered the following amendments to the foregoing application: ~\tLimit beginning student count to 400; ~\tLimit increase in size to 100 students per year with the maximum enrollment capped at 1000 students; ~\tBoard review of school every 2 years; ~\tReview the schoolï¿½s hours of operations; ~\tFocus on creating a hi-tech agricultural program/center. Mr. Thomas voiced his concerns regarding the implementation of the proffered suggestions particularly the busing component and requested additional time to meet with the homeowners. Commissioner Souto moved to defer the foregoing application. Commissioner Diaz seconded the deferral with the stipulation that there be no more testimony on the item when next it was considered by the Board. Mr. Bileca stated he was confident a compromise could be reached within the parameters proposed by Commissioner Souto. Discussion ensued between Chairman Bovo, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Kogon regarding scheduling. Chairman Bovo asked staff to analyze split shifts on traffic. Responding to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question as to the current enrollment at the Sunset location, Mr. Arza explained enrollment was capped at 380 students. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to defer the item to the November 15, 2018 Zoning meeting. Chairman Bovo reiterated there would be no public hearing when the item was heard on November 15, 2018.

Mr. Graham Penn, Bercow Radell Fernandez & Larkin, 200 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, Iglesia De Dios Puerta De Salvacion, Inc.  He advised the Board members that there were no protests or waivers filed in conjunction with the foregoing item and explained the application sought to make a minor adjustment to one of the urban center boundaries.  Mr. Penn pointed out the item involved .77 acres of land which would allow the unified development of the churchï¿½s property. Mr. Penn stated the site was currently used as a dirt parking lot and noted the additional land would continue to be used as a parking lot in the redevelopment of the property as a kidney care center. Commissioner Monestime voiced his support for the foregoing application given staffï¿½s recommendations. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing and called for persons wishing to speak on this item. There being no persons appearing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel noted the Board adopted legislation (Ordinance No. 18-124) at yesterdayï¿½s (10/2) Board of County Commissionersï¿½ (BCC) meeting which updated the standard urban center district regulations and explained once the ordinance took effect the Boardï¿½s ruling on the foregoing item as it relates to Request Nos. 3 and 4 to amend the density and building regulation plan would be superseded. Commissioner Monestime commented that Request No. 4 sought to amend the building height regulating plan to allow a maximum height of four (4) stories. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reiterated Ordinance No. 18-124 amended the standard Urban Center District regulations to establish density and height standards for Urban Center and Urban Area Zoning Districts. Mr. Kogon clarified Requests Nos. 3 and 4 were moot since Ordinance No. 18-124 established density and height standards for Urban Centers and Urban Area Zoning Districts. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to approve staffï¿½s recommendation. 2. 182350 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources HEARING NO. 18-095  --  DISTRICTS(S) 03  --  GARTH C.

Edmonson Seconder: Jean Monestime Vote: 12 - 0 Absent: Suarez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services Division, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application.  He stated there were no protests or waivers filed in the foregoing application. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the Board members that the foregoing application was requesting a map amendment that would ultimately be governed by recently adopted Ordinance No. O-18-124 which amended Section 33-284.84 and created Section 33-284.84.1 of the County Code to revise the standard Urban Center District regulations to establish density and height standards for Urban Center and Urban Area Zoning Districts.  He noted while the ordinance was adopted by the Board of County Commissioners (BCC) at yesterdayï¿½s (10/2) meeting it was technically not yet in effect which left zoning applications such like foregoing item in limbo.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that the Boardï¿½s ruling on the foregoing application would be superseded once the ordinance took effect and density or height issues would now be dealt with by the ordinance. Mr. Graham Penn, Bercow, Radell, Fernandez and Larkin, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, counsel for Cornerstone Group, provided a brief review of the foregoing application. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing and called for persons wishing to speak on this item. There being no persons appearing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Commissioner Edmonson moved to approve staff's recommendations.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Heyman and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 13-0. Later during the meeting, Commissioner Edmonson moved to reconsider the foregoing application. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Sosa; and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 13-0. Commissioner Edmonson stated she was just made aware that there were members of the community present wishing to speak on the application but due to the lengthy lines were not able to sign in before the item was first considered by the Board.  She pointed out Commissioners  were unable to communicate with their constituents on zoning applications prior to them being presented to the Board for consideration and noted staff indicated there were no protests or waivers filed against the application.  Commissioner Edmonson indicated the speakers would be provided an opportunity to address the Board. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out both the applicant and their counsel were absent and requested the speakers wait until they were present to speak on the item. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Edmonson and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel as to whether applicants typically met with residents regarding zoning matters. Commissioner Edmonson spoke about the need to improve the process for registering public speakers on meeting days, particularly when there was  a large turnout. Chairman Bovo concurred that the process needed to be reviewed and improved. Upon the return of Mr. Penn and the applicant, Chairman Bovo reopened the public hearing and the following persons appeared in opposition of the item: Mr. Louis E. Sparks, 1140 NW 76th Street, Miami Ms. Carolyn Boyce, 880 NW 77th Street, Miami Mr. Gavin Tong, 1131 NW 75th Street, Miami There being no other persons wishing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Mr. Penn acknowledged the concerns raised by the residents regarding increased density and traffic to the area and the overall quality of the development and pointed out that Cornerstone Group had successfully developed Hibiscus Pointe which was located within the Urban Center and west of the subject site. With the aid of a map, Mr. Penn reviewed the proposed plans for the development. Commissioner Edmonson inquired about the proposed development for the subject site and inquired whether the applicant or any of the applicantï¿½s representatives had met with the community regarding the proposed development. Mr. Penn advised the Board members that the developer proposed building a tax credit community offering affordable housing and spoke about the impending deadline for the 2018 application cycle.  He noted his colleague, Mr. Knight, had met with Mr. Sparks regarding the proposed development. Commissioner Edmonson voiced her concerns regarding the fact that the applicant had not met with the community as a whole and moved to defer the foregoing application to allow the applicant time to meet with the residents. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Edmonson, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Penn regarding scheduling. Mr. Penn reiterated the 2018 Affordable Housing process deadline was October 23, 2018 and noted a deferral past this date would delay the project by an additional year.  He indicated that while the developer may be able to work with the community to address their objections to the proposed multilevel development, it should be done during the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process. Commissioner Edmonson asked whether the applicant would be amendable to preserving the current neighborhood character by building single family homes or duplexes. Mr. Penn indicated that the applicant could not commit to building single family homes. Commissioner Edmonson moved to defer the foregoing application until October 25, 2018 to allow the applicant an opportunity to meet with the residents.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel about the Affordable Housing Application Process deadline and the impact of the deferral on the process. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified in the event the foregoing application was denied without prejudice by the BCC, there was a one year waiting period before the applicant could reapply. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question as to the location of the subject property and the current zoning designation for the site, Mr. Penn indicated that the property was located between 12th Avenue and 79th Street and currently zoned for RU1 and RU2 type development ï¿½ duplexes or single family homes. Commissioner Edmonson urged the applicant to meet with the community to review the proposed development plans and requested the Board consider scheduling a special meeting to revisit the item. Discussion ensued among various Commissioners regarding scheduling. Commissioner Martinez suggested the applicant and community members confer amongst themselves while the Board considered the remainder of the agenda. Commissioner Edmonson stated she believed it would be better for the applicant to meet with the entire community instead of talking with the residents present at todayï¿½s meeting. Commissioner Jordan asked whether the applicant would consider building duplexes. Mr. Penn noted the developer planned on building three story garden styled homes and explained it was not financially feasible for the developer to build single family homes or duplexes. Commissioner Edmonson reiterated the importance of the applicant meeting with the whole community and restated her motion to defer the application. Commissioner Moss indicated his support for deferring the application to allow the applicant time to meet with the residents and inquired about the process for filing the Affordable Housing application to the State. Mr. Penn explained that the application could be filed electronically with a physical copy delivered to Tallahassee on or before October 23, 2018. Chairman Bovo suggested deferring the application until the October 23, 2018 BCC hearing. Responding to Commissioner Edmonsonï¿½s question as to whether she would be permitted to communicate with residents regarding the application, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that while she was prohibited from doing so due to the Jennings Rule, staff could provide support. Commissioner Edmonson moved to defer the foregoing application until October 23, 2018.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan; and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 12-0 (Commissioner Suarez was absent). Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the application would be included under the quasi-judicial portion of the BCC Agenda on October 23, 2018.

He spoke highly of the school and mentioned a partnership to provide afterschool care programs. The following speakers appeared in support of the item: Dr. Mary Ledo, Ms. Rebecca Wolz, Ms. Stephanie Hernandez, Ms. Trudi Kroger, Ms. Katerin Flores,  Ms. Diana Moreira and Ms. Brendliz Jimenez. Chairman Bovo also recognized the speakers who waved in support of the item. Prior to leaving the meeting, Commissioner Jordan stated she supported the item. Seeing no other person wishing to speak, Vice-Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. In response to Commissioner Moss ï¿½ question, Mr. Carlos Webenz (phonetic), 7344 SW 48 Street, Miami, FL advised the AcadeMir Charter school located at 19185 SW 127 Ave. Miami, FL opened three years ago and was built as one application built in two phases due to the time of construction. Commissioner Moss inquired how charter school zoning issues were handled in other counties. Mr. Mayol commented the process varied with each municipality within Miami-Dade County, but was unable to provide an answer for any other county. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised this process was established through the interlocal agreement with the school board and noted a statute governs the different options.  He stated the Board was not obligated to go through this process, but a renegotiation with the school board would be required. In response to Commissioner Moss ï¿½s question inquiring whether Miami-Dade County was mandated to address this ongoing charter school issue, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated this was the current process due to the interlocal agreement with the school board which mandates a public hearing be held before this Board of County Commissioners. Commissioner Moss requested that Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel, along with staff, create legislation to revise the public hearing process for charter schools. Mr. Kogon pointed out that staff offered some review on public schools, but the public hearings were conducted under the jurisdiction of the school board. Commissioner Moss thanked the parents for appearing in support of their school and mentioned he previously supported choice for a number of charter school applications.  He referenced the impact of traffic in the community and asked if choice outweighs the impact of a new school in an area.  Commissioner Moss expressed concern with moving forward with this item and moved to deny the application. Commissioner Sosa expressed concern with enrollment in both schools creating overcrowding, additional transportation issues, and noted she supported the district commissioner. Commissioner Martinez stated he supported the district commissioner, but asked the difference between this application versus the previous application that was approved. Commissioner Moss stated in the other application there was extreme density and AcadeMir was approved in the other location, but pointed out he supported a number of choice schools and wanted to ensure the choice school was in the right location which were able to sustain the impact of a new school in the community.  He urged Mr. Oher to also consider creating afterschool programs for a number of other willing schools in the area. Commissioner Diaz stated although he heard the comments of the speakers, he respected the opinion of the district commissioner. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to deny the application. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-22-18. 7/19/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners D. 182351 Zoning HEARING NO.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t December 16, 2018 Zoning Z-29-18 Mover: Xavier L. Suarez Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 12 - 0 Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER), read the item into the record; noting there was one protest and no waivers.  Mr. Kogon apprised the Board that there was a section in the Zoning Code in the addendum that was listed incorrectly; however, the staff report did not rely on that section. With regards to Mr. Koganï¿½s comment regarding the addendum, Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Coconut Grove, Florida representative of the Red Road Snapper Creek Neighbors Association, requested a deferral on this item because the staff report specifically cited a section regarding the modification of a restrictive covenant.  Mr. Gibbs stated this was the incorrect section of the Code and he had relied on this incorrect information as it was printed in the staff report.  He noted that nowhere else in the staff report did it indicate staff was relying on a different section, and requested the deferral to allow staff to correct their error. Commissioner Suarez made a motion to defer the foregoing application.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Heyman. Mr. Simon Ferro, 600 Brickell Avenue Miami, Florida representing the applicant, noted he objected to the deferral.  He pointed out that staff delineated their reasons for supporting deletion of the covenant in the body of the recommendation and did not cite this section, and whatever section it would be based on was in the Zoning Code and all of the Zoning Code was public record.  Mr. Ferro said he did not believe this warranted a deferral and explained the arguments for deletion of the covenant were clearly stated.  He opined this did not place Mr. Gibbs at a disadvantage. Mr. Gibbs explained that the staff report which was the official statement reviewed by the legal department said specifically applicable Code sections, not the entire Code, and cites specifically to the Code which was not applicable.  He noted he believed this was an unintentional bait and switch, but it placed those who relied on RER staff at a disadvantage.  This warranted correcting the problem, and bringing the item back for a debate on an even playing field, Mr. Gibbs said. Commissioner Diaz asked the county attorneys for guidance on this matter. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the staff report did not rely on the erroneous citation.  He said the fact that there was an erroneous citation was something that while the County  may ultimately prevail on an appeal based on the substance,  would result in  the item coming  back to the Board even if they won, based on a failure to apply the essential requirements of the law because it relied on the wrong standard.   Assistant County Attorney Kerbel further advised the Board to defer the item to avoid an appellate issue because it did not resolve the application itself, and to allow staff to correct the report. Commissioner Suarez noted he would maintain his motion to defer; and requested Mr. Ferro place on the record that the street closure issue would no longer be a part of the application. Mr. Ferro explained that Commissioner Suarez was correct, noting initially when this application was filed because it is in the Downtown Kendall Urban Center District, that District required connectivity of all streets.  He noted since there was a barricade on 67th Avenue and 84th Street which the property abuts, the applicant was initially asked by staff to incorporate removing the guard rail and barricade from 67th Avenue because that was the only way they would be in compliance with the District regulations. Mr. Ferro said when the applicant found out the neighbors were upset about this, he went to staff and subsequently the applicant amended the request.  He noted staff advised the applicant had to request a variance in the application to move forward when there was a street that had no connectivity and the application was deferred in May.  Mr. Ferro explained the applicant revised the plan and requested the variance to allow the barricade to remain in place.  He pointed out that removal of the barricade was never a part of the application and if the application was approved the barricade would remain in place. 5/3/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B. 182346 Zoning HEARING NO.

Mr. Jeffery Berkow, 200 S Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida noted he had been in discussion with staff and discovered a notice issue which may require a remand.  He inquired if the contiguous property had been included would it change the notice radius. Responding to Mr. Berkowï¿½s inquiry, Mr. Kogon indicated that if the contiguous property was included it would change the notice radius. Mr. Berkow announced that the applicant could not be heard today, and the application must be remanded for appropriate notice and go back to Community Council. Assistant County Attorney Lauren Morse clarified that the appropriate motion would be to vacate the decision of the Community Zoning Approval Board (CZAB) and remand to the CZAB for consideration with leave to amend to include the proper application with the correct zoning radius. 10/3/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board C. 180352 Zoning HEARING NO.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Motion to deny Zoning Z-23-18 Mover: Sally A. Heyman Seconder: Joe A. Martinez Vote: 8 - 1 No: Monestime Absent: Jordan , Sosa , Diaz Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER), read the item into the record; noting there were 204 protests and 112 waivers. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing. Mr. Paul Savage, 2525 Ponce De Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables, Florida representing the Jockey Club Condominium Inc. . (or Jockey Tower I), noted he was co-council to Edward Martos. Mr. Edward Martos, 2525 Ponce De Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables, Florida representing Jockey Club Phase II, appeared before the Board and noted that the item being considered today represented three requests from the Jockey Club.  The first of these requests contends that staff misinterpreted the County Code when completing the analysis for an underlying application; that application was for the developer Apeiron.  Mr. Martos explained the second claim was that approval of the developerï¿½s application constitutes a deprivation of his clientï¿½s and co-councilï¿½s clientï¿½s property rights.  He noted the applicant had easements over the same land the developer was building on and had never consented to that construction; therefore, this represented a deprivation of the applicantï¿½s easement rights.  Mr. Martos asked that pursuant to multiple sections of the county code, including Section 33-314(E), that the County take jurisdiction over the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s decision and over turn their ruling.  He explained that these code provisions gave the Board that expressive authority anytime that it was challenged that the administrative staff had misinterpreted the code, if it would result in a lawsuit, or if the decision led to taking of property. Mr. Martos submitted copies and summary documents with all points and details regarding the foregoing application; and 66 letters from Jockey Club owners to the Clerk. Mr. Martos advised the application had three points, and each of these points had a continuing theme of compatibility. He  pointed out  the developerï¿½s proposed project  did not meet compatibility requirements with respect to the Countyï¿½s zoning code, the Countyï¿½s comprehensive plan and was  incompatible with the neighborhood. With regards to Mr. Martosï¿½ comments, Mr. Augusto Maxwell, Ackerman LLP, representing the applicant Apeiron Miami, explained that the appellantï¿½s representatives were giving erroneous arguments as the staff recommendation informed the applicant that the zoning issue was not before the Board today.  He pointed out if the Board decided to take up the zoning issue today, it had not been properly noticed and would trigger the applicantï¿½s vested rights claim.  Mr. Maxwell further explained what was before the Board today was an appeal of a takings claim.  He said if the Board allowed a discussion regarding zoning, this would set a bad precedence and possibly opening a substantive takings claim. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the staff report summarized legal staffï¿½s view of the matter. He further advised that because of the way the zoning procedures ordinance worked, this was not a do over of the underlying zoning application.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel said the appellants had appropriately preserved all of the issues and may take them up with the Circuit Court at the conclusion of this hearing.  He advised the issue before the Board was only on the vested rights and the question was not based on compatibility grounds or any other issue, but did anything in the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s (CZAB) approval of the application abrogate the vested rights held by Jockey I and II.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained the recommendation was made by the Development Impact Committee, and accepted by the CZAB that there were no vested rights abrogated by the approval of this application.  He pointed out that should be the focus of their presentations.  Jockey I and II had separately appealed staffï¿½s interpretation regarding setback issues and height calculations that related to the underlying zoning application.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel said the Zoning Code did not allow an objector to hijack the underlying zoning application and bring pieces of legal issues to the Board to review outside of the normal CZAB process.  He explained the normal CZAB process and stated the only thing the Board should address was the vested rights and takings claims. Chairman Bovo relinquished the chair to Vice Chairwoman Edmonson. Vice Chairwoman Edmonson reiterated the Board only needed to hear the vested rights and the takings claims. Mr. Martos gave a Power Point Presentation addressing Code provisions, and asked Vice Chairwoman Edmonson to allow him to make a full presentation. Commissioner Heyman noted she believed it was appropriate to let Mr. Martos be heard as long as it did not conflict with any court proceedings. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s inquiry whether the Board could bypass this presentation and send this item to the Circuit Court, Mr. Kerbel explained that it would be the Boardï¿½s decision that would go to the Circuit Court; thus, ultimately this item would be properly before the Court once the Board made the final decision on the vested rights claim. Mr. Martos continued with his presentation.  He gave a brief history regarding the Jockey Club, discussed the administrative appeal, reviewed maps and outlines of the Jockey Club, and discussed building height and setbacks. Mr. Rob Curtis, 7520 Red Road Miami, Florida noted the building was 548 feet and the setback was 7 feet.  He said the plan incorrectly measured the proposed north setback with regards to the interior lot lines, and explained the formula used to measure, noting the requirements of the zoning code were inconsistent for non-use variance. Responding to Mr. Martosï¿½ inquiry regarding whether he would classify the building in question as a low rise, Mr. Curtis noted the building was classified as a super high rise. Mr. Martos asked Mr. Curtis a series of questions in relation to the designation of the building. Mr. Paul Savage, representing Jockey Club Phase I, noted his portion of the presentation dealt with the vested rights.  He pointed out in 1995 the applicant recorded their easement as a part of the title that runs with the land. Mr. Savage referenced an exhibit displaying the layout of the Jockey Club community and an exhibit, Tab D, which was handed out during the meeting which gave them legal rights of not only the pool but the surrounding area which spanned for 99 years. He also noted this was a significant real property interest; a vested interest protected by the Florida and Federal Constitutions.  Mr. Savage said approval of this project contemplated demolishing the pool and putting in a new pool, and to approve this would be a violation of vested rights. Mr. Savage further explained easement rights and the violation of vested rights. In conclusion, he asserted his clientï¿½s vested rights to these easements areas lasted for 99 years; respectfully invoked the vested rights ordinance; and requested the Board deny the application and reverse the CZABï¿½s opinion. Mr. Augusto Maxwell, Ackerman LLP, 98 SE 7th Street Miami, Florida, representing the applicant Apeiron Miami, LLC inquired whether Mr. Rob Curtis had testified before the Development Impact Committee (DIC) or the CZAB. Responding to Mr. Maxwellï¿½s inquiry, Mr. Martos verified that Mr. Curtis had never testified before the DIC or the CZAB. Mr. Maxwell stated that he moved to strike his testimony from the record should this matter move forward with an appeal of the zoning matter.  He stated it was not appropriate to bring in this evidence to support or not support the CZAB approval. Mr. Maxwell suggested the Board reject the appeal before them today as it requested the Board to violate fundamental principles.  He noted the appellant was asking the Board to ignore law that states that the Countyï¿½s zoning actions did not impact private agreements such as easements. Mr. Maxwell referenced an exhibit and noted Judge Thornton had issued a 27 page judgement after 4 days of hearing that expressly rejected the reading that was presented to the Board today. He said this appeal was asking the Board to throw out Judge Thorntonï¿½s opinion, and he was confident that their reading of these complicated documents from 1995 was correct.  Mr. Maxwell noted Judge Thronton had also stated that Apeiron had not mistreated Jockey Clubs I and II in favor of Jockey Club III. Mr. Maxwell stated that he believed it was frivolous to ask the Board of County Commissioners (Board) and CZABs to review private agreements, and to ask the Board to ignore the rule that 75% of property owners could rezone property.  He pointed out this was not a small minor rule,  but an essential rule that had been with the county from its inception, noting  the County Code provides that property owners do not have an absolute right to veto any zoning action.  Mr. Maxwell advised this appeal had a countywide impact and was disruptive for the county as a whole. Mr. Maxwell provided a brief timeline of the entitlement process via a Power Point Presentation.  He noted the applicant had followed the process and the CZAB had unanimously confirmed that they had met the code requirement.  Mr. Maxwell said for these types of frivolous arguments to come forward would provide the following types of damages: -Apeironï¿½s vested rights claim and; -Apeironï¿½s takings claim. Mr. Jeff Berkow, Berkow, Radell, Fernandez & Larkin, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, representing Jockey Club III, noted he was in support of Apeironï¿½s position. Commissioner Heyman requested that each resident coming to speak place on the record which Jockey Club building they resided in. Ms. Beatrice Noel, 11111 Biscayne Boulevard (Jockey Club II), Miami, Florida spoke in opposition to the application.  She noted she was a resident of Jockey Club and that when the original Jockey Club failed in 2017, the 411 unit owners managed and maintained the property as a private residential multi-family complex, never opened to the public, and the marina and hotel was no longer in operation.  Ms. Noel expressed her concern with Apeiron and its shareholders, noting they had not developed good faith with the community and since obtaining the property, Apeiron did not maintain it very well.  She said Apeiron had not repaired the marina; the damaged seawall was still in disrepair; there were potholes; destroyed sidewalks, and many lights that did not work.  Ms. Noel said the financing was questionable since the property was not being maintained and there was not any transparency or full disclosure of what was occurring.  Chairman Bovo resumed the Chair. Ms. Milena Macias, President, Jockey Club I, 11111 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida noted she was opposed to any development by Apeiron. She expressed her concern regarding Apeironï¿½s neglect to take care of the property, noting the owners had made a good faith effort to negotiate with Apeiron and had not been successful. Ms. Allison Robie, 2131 NE 179th Street North Miami Beach, Florida noted she was the property manager at the Jockey Club complex and a representative of Apeiron.  Ms. Robie spoke in support of the foregoing application and noted that Apeiron was in the process of repairing many of the issues at the Jockey Club.  She stated the proposed project needed to move forward. Ms. Debra Sunkle Kolsky, 11113 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida (Jockey Club III) noted she was a resident and the Vice President of Jockey Club III.  She requested that the Board deny the foregoing application. Ms. Maria del Rio, 11111 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida noted she was the Vice President of Jockey Club I and spoke in opposition of the foregoing proposed application. She noted she was unhappy with Apeiron because they had not maintained the Jockey Club. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court Miami, Florida representing the Cricket Club, said that his client wanted him to place the arguments and objections made by the Jockey Club I & IIï¿½s representatives on the record.  He noted he would like to incorporate the statements made before the Community Council number 7 in this matter. Mr. Gibbs pointed out that he wanted to focus on the use variance and listed the use variances. Mr. Spotswood Dudley, 11113 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida noted he was the President of Jockey Club III, and was in support of the foregoing proposed application.  Mr. Dudley pointed out that Apeiron wanted to bring back the hotel, and he wanted everyone to realize that this was the savior of a deteriorating building, and this new development was greatly needed. Dr. Keisha Abraham, 11113 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida (Jockey Club III) noted that she was a new resident and loved the property.  She said she made the purchase due to the upcoming new development and noted her support for the foregoing proposed application. Mr. Benigaz Macias, 11111 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida (Jockey Club I) suggested   the commissioners view the property that was in disrepair.  He noted Apeiron would not complete minor repairs. Ms. Susan Stuart, 11113 Biscayne Boulevard Miami, Florida (Jockey Club III) noted that she moved into the Jockey Club in 2015, and there were potholes and broken light posts. Ms. Stuart spoke about the disrepair of the grounds and said nothing had been maintained or repaired since 2015.  She noted this was not new, the residents contributed to maintenance of the common areas; however, no repairs were ever made. Chairman Bovo closed the Public Hearing. Mr. Paul Savage and Mr. Martos gave their closing rebuttal arguments regarding the different legal positions of the applicants. Commissioner Heyman inquired about the easements and asked the Assistant County Attorney to clarify the easements. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that any action the Board took today would abrogate the rights to those easements.  He pointed out the appellants were incorrect, and were mixing and matching private rights and this countyï¿½s regulatory authority.   Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the application that was before the CZAB was seeking permission to modify the site plan; and while that site plan called for potential impacts to the easements, it did not mandate that anything be changed; it gave permission.  He opined that CZAB did nothing in terms of approving the site plan that affected their easement right.   Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out that Mr. Savage was correct regarding easements being private property rights and were protected; however, nothing CZAB did or what the Board would do today would abrogate the rights, and they could continue to enforce them with Circuit Court action on those private rights as a private matter. With regards to the point Mr. Martos raised earlier regarding the application being before the Board, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that when the code says the Board has authority over all parts of an application, usually if a district boundary change was before the Board, it could also consider variances.  He advised in this case, the application was the appeal of the vested rights, and clarified   the application before the Board was not the underlying zoning application and that was how it was distinguished in the report. Commissioner Heyman said she was familiar with the Jockey Club and its history.  She noted the issues pre-existed the new developers, and requested ode enforcement staff handle the current violations at the Jockey Club. Commissioner Heyman pointed out the Board of County Commissioners should not address what were clearly court obligations; and therefore could not address heights and compatibility issues.  Commissioner Heyman made a motion to deny both appeals. In addition the application filed by Apeiron Miami, was denied based on motion duly made by Commissioner Heyman and seconded by Commissioner Martinez, and upon being put to a vote, passed by a vote of 8-1 (Commissioner Monestime voted No; and Commissioners Jordan, Sosa, Diaz and Moss were absent).  This zoning application was assigned zoning resolution number Z-31-18. 2/22/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board 4/26/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 7/19/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 9/27/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners D. 181778 Zoning HEARING NO: Z2017000274  --  DISTRICT(S): 08  --  11990 SILVER PALM, LLC.  --  REQUEST(S): - THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO ALLOW A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM AU, AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT, TO RU-1M(B), SINGLE-FAMILY MODIFIED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved as amended Zoning Z-24-18 Mover: Daniella Levine Cava Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Souto Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER), read the item into the record; noting there were 13 protests and no waivers. Mr. Javier Fernandez, representative for the applicant, noted a number of issues were raised by Commissioners Levine Cava and Jordan specifically relating to past failures to maintain the Natural Forest Community (NFC); a request for the reduction of the NFC to less than 20% of the future provisions for its restoration and maintenance, as well as questions regarding density.  With respect to the past degradation the applicant may have mistakenly created the impression that successive profit driven owners had allowed the property to degrade by neglecting it.  Mr. Fernandez asked Board members to review the document that delineated evidence of how the parcel was used. He explained that prior to the applicantï¿½s purchase of this property in July 2017, the site had been owned by the Humane Society of Greater Miami; the uses were charitable in nature and not profit driven; therefore, it was fair to conclude that while the Humane Society struggled to maintain the NFC in a pristine state, this was not done in any intent to degrade the property by neglect.  Mr. Fernandez said this supported the conclusion that the preservation and future maintenance of this NFC required a companion development permit that would create a mechanism to execute management and future preservation. With respect to the removal of a portion of the NFC, Mr. Fernandez commented on removal of up to 20% of the NFC if the applicant was able to demonstrate that the NFC precluded a reasonable use of the property.  He explained that in order to preserve 20% of the NFC that had been the subject of complaint would eliminate 8 of the 19 proposed lots on the property which was 42% of the proposed density, making the proposed project economically unfeasible.  Mr. Fernandez opined it was reasonable to request the removal of this section to allow for the reasonable use of the balance of the property.  He further explained that upon analyzing the property, it was found that the NFC portion of the property that was subject for removal had been overrun by exotics and would have no impact on any federally protected flora or fauna within the NFC.  Mr. Fernandez noted that he recommended creating a special taxing district that would provide a recurring source of funding for the ongoing maintenance of this portion of the property. Lastly, Mr. Fernandez addressed the concerns regarding density, noting  the proposal as presented was equivalent to the EUM designation and RU-1 densities in the area, and the RU-1M(b) was a designation the applicant had arrived at with the suggestion from staff, as it required the least amount of variances in order to accomplish the same effect. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Fernandez regarding preservation of the NFC area of the property and its density. Mr. Fernandez explained that in terms of trying to preserve the balance of the NFC, there was not a feasible way to do so and still utilize the four proposed lots. Commissioner Levine Cava noted that she was concerned about the pine rockland because it had been greatly reduced due to development.  She pointed out that she was eager to see if the land could be restored naturally, and wanted to be mindful of the neighborsï¿½ request to reduce density.  Commissioner Levine Cava noted she appreciated the concession to reduce the traffic and requested to review the final covenants. It was moved by Commissioner Levine Cava to amend the foregoing application with the acceptance of the covenant with the additional condition requiring a special taxing district to address the maintenance of the natural aesthetics of the community. 7/19/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 9/27/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 10/3/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board E. 181375 Zoning HEARING NO.

Martinez Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Cava Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources Department, read the foregoing application into the record; noting 667 protests and no waivers. Chairman Bovo pointed out the public hearing was closed and would not be re-opened because a public hearing had already taken place for this item. Mr. Hugo Arza, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, representing the applicant, expressed appreciation to the parents who were in attendance of todayï¿½s (11/15) meeting, although the public hearing was closed.  He recalled his presentation to the Board regarding this application and the project itself, and indicated the Board members urged the applicant to work with the neighbors to reach a settlement on this project and return to the Board.  Mr. Arza explained that he and the applicant met with the neighbors on several occasions and recently held more formal meetings; and made presentations and a proposal.  Unfortunately, despite the applicantï¿½s best efforts, the applicantï¿½s proposal with conditions had been rejected, with no counter proposal.  Mr. Arza said he trusted the Board would see the value of a school at this location and pointed out that he and the applicant were prepared to make the same proposal to the Board today that he made to the neighborhood association.  He referenced staffï¿½s recommendation of approval with conditions, noting many were standard conditions, while others were specific to this project.  Mr. Arza explained the applicant had embedded the original offer made to the neighborhood association into the series of conditions, and requested a motion be made to include those conditions if it was the Boardï¿½s desire. Mr. Arza gave a brief description of the proposal for consideration.  He noted one concern was the recommendation of 1,450 students being enrolled; however, the applicant understood the traffic issue this could create; and although approval was recommended for 1,450 students, the applicant made a reduction in the total number of students to 1,000 by the 7th year.  In addition to the cap of 1,000 students, Mr. Arza noted the school would initially begin operating with 400 students and slowly increase to the 1,000 student cap, thus phasing in a systematic growth pattern which would allow the school and the community to grow together.  In connection with the student enrollment, Mr. Arza said the applicant proffered in the conditions that they would not seek an enrollment increase beyond 1,000 students unless they were able to secure 75% of the property ownersï¿½ signatures who were within 2500 feet of horse country.  He explained the applicant offered to make improvements to SW 118th Avenue by adding an additional lane to address traffic congestion, noting that preserving horse country was critical and the applicant wanted to pay respect to the agricultural community. Mr. Arza further explained the applicant was working with Florida International University to implement agricultural sciences that would allow horse country to evolve and grow.  In closing, Mr. Arza urged the Board to consider the conditions the applicant offered and approve the application. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Coconut Grove, Florida representing horse country, noted that he attended the meetings between the neighbors and the applicant.  Mr. Gibbs pointed out that the cap of 1,000 students was not enough and stated that adding 1,000 students would contribute to the congested to traffic on Miller Drive. He noted that more schools were being developed in this neighborhood and the schools needed to be small.  Mr. Gibbs stated that he understood the applicant wanted to construct a charter school in that location, however, the neighbors rejected the applicantï¿½s offer due to the amount of students proposed.  He inquired how many more schools would be approved in this area creating more traffic congestion. Commissioner Souto noted his decision did not reflect on the quality of the school, but was based on the number of students and the amount of traffic this would generate in the area.  He noted he was not in support of the foregoing application and made a motion to deny the application. 5/31/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 9/27/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 10/3/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board F. 182351 Zoning HEARING NO.

Martinez Vote: 12 - 0 Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources Department, noted the applicant wished to defer the foregoing application to the December 6, 2018 meeting. A representative of the applicant came forward stating that they were ready to move forward; however, he had a hearing to attend at 2 p.m. today and requested to be taken out of order. Commissioner Heyman noted she was ready to move forward with this application. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER), read the item into the record; noting there were no protests or waivers. Commissioner Heyman noted that while the applicant was entitled to a large amount of residential units and four stories, it was not effective in a residential mixed use with two religious schools and an elementary school in the area. She requested the covenants for restriction be placed on the record. Mr. Kogon noted the applicant proffered a declaration of restrictions limiting the property to 18 units with a maximum height of three stories. Mr. Miguel Diaz De La Portilla, 200 S Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida noted the applicant accepted staffï¿½s recommendation of approval along with the proffered declaration of restrictions. He asked for the Boardï¿½s support of the staffï¿½s recommendation. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, seeing no one come forward the public hearing was closed. 10/3/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board 10/25/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners CURRENT: 1. 182709 Zoning HEARING NO.

Edmonson Vote: 12 - 0 Excused: Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER), read the item into the record; noting there were no protests or waivers. Mr. Kogon explained this item was a special exception to delineate the boundary to bring in the Government Center Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ).  He noted this was the technical procedure to bring it in, and did not change any of the standards that were previously adopted by the Board. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing, seeing no one come forward the public hearing was closed. Commissioner Higgins noted she was pleased to learn that the Government Center in this district was being added as a RTZ.  She also noted that urban core areas had more dense districts and many of the buildings used Miami 21 zoning code.  Commissioner Higgins pointed out that these buildings did not accommodate Uber or Uber Eats pickups and drop-offs, which created traffic jams in front of the buildings.  She inquired if any current Zoning Codes covered this particular issue, so the traffic problem was not perpetuated. Mr. Kogan noted he could review the site plan process; however, it was always better to codify a standard so it was a guarantee.  He recommended in an effort to support the drop-off/pick up areas, a legislative item be created amending the standards to allow for special drop off areas to facilitate adequate traffic flow.  Mr. Kogon informed the Board that a condition could be placed as part of this special condition in the interim so that should an application come prior to the legislative item, staff could include these conditions to cover both basis. Commissioner Higgins said she would like to work with the Administration to analyze and prepare the recommended legislation.  She pointed out this would help RTZs in Downtown and the Brickell area.  Commissioner Higgins said as density had increased some streets in her District were being congested with Uber and Lyft pick-ups and drop-offs. Chairman Bovo noted this was a new dynamic that needed to be worked out and indicated that he would like to work with Commissioner Higgins on this legislation. Chairman Bovo re-opened the public hearing. Ms. Gloria Thomas, 401 NW 6th Street, Miami, Florida spoke against the foregoing application.  She noted she had a home in Overtown and feared she and other Overtown residents were about to lose their home.  Ms. Thomas stated it was not fair to give away their homes and there was no need to build more Metrorail in the area. Chairman Bovo clarified that the county was not building any Metrorail nor taking away any oneï¿½s homes and this would not affect her property at all. Mr. Charles Cutler, 708 NW 4th Avenue, Miami, Florida spoke regarding eminent domain, and noted that he was not provided with adequate information, but noted Chairman Bovoï¿½s previous comments answered his questions. Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. 19 ADJOURNMENT REPORT: Seeing no further business come before the Board the meeting was adjourned at 1:15 p.m. 3 CONSENT AGENDA 9/25/2024 Agenda Key: 4189 Home | Agendas | Minutes | Legislative Search | Lobbyist Registration | Legislative Reports 2024 BCC Meeting Calendar | Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances | ADA Notice | Home | Using Our Site | About | Phone\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDirectory | Privacy | Disclaimer E-mail your comments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions and suggestions to Webmaster Web Site\r\n\t\t\t\t\tï¿½ 2024 Miami-Dade County.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved as amended Zoning Z-28-18 Mover: Daniella Levine Cava Seconder: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Vote: 11 - 1 No: Suarez Absent: Heyman REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 19 protests and 387 waivers filed. Mr. Richard Perez, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, South Riviera Investments No. 2, Inc.  He advised the Board members that the applicant met with and retained the support from some of the neighbors most impacted by the proposed development along SW 120th Avenue, including Mr. Manuel Dorta-Duque. Mr. Perez noted his client and Mr. Dorta-Duque negotiated the following conditions and requested they be added to the approval conditions: ~\tCondition No. 18 - Make improvements to SW 120th Avenue by providing a T-Turn around at the end of the propertyï¿½s boundary; ~\tCondition No 19 ï¿½ Resurface SW 120th Avenue with asphalt, north of the T-Turn around to SW 240th Street ~\tCondition No. 20 ï¿½ Submit a traffic signal warrant study to the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) for review and approval and pay for the installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of SW 122nd Avenue and SW 248th Street, if warranted. Mr. Perez explained the purpose of the T-Turn citing safety concerns and spoke about the applicantï¿½s intent to dedicate and pave SW 120th Avenue.  He noted once the roadway was fully dedicated, it would be up to DTPW to decide on how to proceed. Mr. Perez advised the Board members that several other neighbors maintained their opposition to the development and refused to meet with the applicant. Mr. Perez noted at the last meeting the Board voiced concerns regarding the overall number of students and the setback requirement.  He informed the Board members that the applicant, in response to these concerns, was prepared to withdraw Request Nos. 2 and 3; and lower the student count to six hundred and eighty five from the original eight hundred and fifty.  Mr. Perez pointed out the reduction did not signify a change in the amenities offered by the school and requested Condition No. 10 be revised to state ï¿½the private school use be limited to Grades K through 8 and be limited to a maximum of six hundred and eighty five students.ï¿½ Mr. Perez argued the modified application was vastly different from the original application and noted the applicant had substantially increased the number of outdoor recreational areas, decreased the student count, withdrawn requests for variances and negotiated agreements with neighbors, resulting in staffï¿½s recommendation for approval. Mr. Perez spoke about the schoolï¿½s mission and parentsï¿½ right to choose a Christian based school; and requested the PowerPoint presentation and revised conditions for approval be entered into evidence. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing and the following speakers appeared before the Board in support of the foregoing item. 1.\tMr. Carlos Hernandez, 11469 SW 200th Street, Homestead, FL 33032 2.\tMr. Manuel Dorta-Duque, 24120 SW 119th Avenue, Miami, FL reported the residents most affected by the school agreed to support the item with the stipulation that the applicant implement guardrails at the north terminus on SW 120thAvenue, resurface the street and install a traffic signal at the intersection of SW 122nd Avenue and SW 248th Street. if deemed necessary. 3.\tMr. Alain Diaz, 24287 SW 114th Court, Homestead, FL 33032 4.\tMr. Erick Lorenzo, 11491 SW 236th Lane, Homestead, FL 33032 5.\tMr. Harold Lamour, 11444 SW 239th Terrace, Miami, FL 33032 6.\tMs. Christine Burdette, 1301 SE 16th Avenue, Homestead, FL 33035 7.\tMs. Patsy Cabrera, 16875 SW 300th Street, Homestead, FL 33030 8.\tMs. Faterrah Harding, 11465 SW 252nd Terrace, Miami, FL 9.\tMs. Charlene Olton, 9990 SW 224th Street, Apartment 305, Cutler Bay, FL 33190 10.\tMs. Yeny Carranza, 22234 SW 98th Place, Cutler Bay, FL 33190 11.\tMs. Anggi Fernandez, 19621 SW 117th Avenue, Miami, FL 33177, waved in support of the item 12.\tMr. Horacio Valdes, 23262 SW 112th Avenue, Miami, FL 33032, waved in support of the item 13.\tMr. Norman De La Cruz, 19621 SW 216th Street, Apartment 240, Miami, FL, waved in support \tof the item 14.\tMs. Danae Otero, 10350 SW 216th Street, Apartment 240, Miami, FL, waved in support of the \titem 15.\tMs. Zuleika Rosales, 11462 SW 248 Terrace, Homestead, FL, waved in support of the item. 16.\tMs. Angelica Serna, 10500 SW 200th Street, Miami, FL 33157, waved in support of the item 17.\tMr. Ludwigh Aarestrup, 11700 Bailes Road, Miami, FL 33170, waved in support of the item 18.\tMs. Jolleenaycka Rodriguez, 12084 SW 249th Street, Miami, FL, waved in support of the item 19.\tMs. Jennifer Leyva, 18725 SW 344th Terrace, Homestead, FL, waved in support of the item 20.\tMs. Jennifer Sanchez, 10841 SW 224th Terrace, Miami, FL 33170, waved in support of the item 21.\tMs. Zaines Marrella, 23753 SW 108th Homestead, FL 33032, waved in support of the item 22.\tMs. Marisleidy Fernandez, 11321 SW 246th Street, Homestead, FL 33032, waved in support of \tthe item The following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.\tMr. Roger Jackson, 24350 SW 122nd Avenue, Miami.

Mr. Perez provided a brief closing statement highlighting the ongoing changes and growth to the community.  He noted SW 248th Street would eventually be widened to support this growth and argued the proposed school was designed with adequate operational features such as auto-stacking, staggered shifts and trained personnel to manage traffic during arrival and dismissal times to handle traffic impacts. Mr. Perez noted in addition to the aforementioned components, the applicant was prepared to implement four vans to aid in the pick-up and drop-off process for each of the three different shifts, thereby providing transportation for up to one hundred and ninety two students. Addressing comments regarding local school capacity; Mr. Perez pointed out the school located within the district boundary, Coconut Palm Academy, currently had no vacancies and reiterated parentsï¿½ decisions to enroll their children at South Riviera was based on the Christian based education offered by the school. Commissioner Levine Cava spoke about the traffic issues facing Commission District 8 and the impact of development on residentï¿½s quality of life.  She acknowledged the concessions made by the applicant thus far and inquired about the applicantï¿½s plan for the schoolï¿½s recreation space given the limited space available. Mr. Perez explained the outdoor recreation space would be utilized in shifts and noted the school also planned on building an indoor gymnasium. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Perez regarding the proposed van transportation component of the applicantï¿½s plan. Mr. Perez reiterated the school would provide free transportation to approximately one hundred and ninety two students via four sixteen seater vans operating three shifts each. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel recommended the van transportation component be included as a new condition as a part of the zoning approval. Commissioner Levine Cava voiced concerns about improper parking by parents and inquired about the schoolï¿½s plans to circumvent this problem. Mr. Perez indicated the applicant was amenable to include the van transportation component as a condition of the schoolï¿½s annual Certificate of Use (CU) renewal process in addition to the schoolï¿½s Traffic Operation Plan (TOP). Discussion ensued among Assistant County Attorney Kerbel, Mr. Kogon and Mr. Perez about the conditions surrounding van use. Commissioner Levine Cava asked whether the schoolï¿½s capacity could be capped at six hundred students. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s request to cap the capacity at six hundred students, Mr. Perez indicated the applicant was willing to cap the schoolï¿½s capacity at six hundred students for the first three years and increase enrollment to six hundred and eighty five students thereafter, upon proof of compliance with the CU for three consecutive years. Commissioner Levine Cava accepted the proffered amendments to the foregoing application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion before the Board and noted a super majority of two-thirds of the members present was needed for approval. Commissioner Levine Cava urged the DTPW to be proactive and not wait until there was a traffic issue. Commissioner Moss reiterated his concern regarding the rise in popularity of private and charter schools despite under enrollment at public schools and spoke about the challenges and consequences of under enrollment on the community and the school system. There being no further questions or comments, the Board, by motion duly made, seconded and carried, approved the application as amended to: ~\tGrant Request No. 1; ~\tWithdraw Requests Nos 2 and 3; ~\tGrant a modified approval of Request No.  4 to limit the number of students to 685; ~\tApprove Request No. 5; ~\tGrant a modified approval of Request No. 6 to permit 109,349 square feet of outdoor recreation with the approval of Condition Nos. 18, 19 and 20, a new condition requiring the applicant provide four - sixteen seater vans to pick-up and drop-off students at each of the three shifts at no extra charge to the parents and incorporated into the TOP subject to approval by the DTPW; and the stipulation that the school capacity school be capped at six hundred students for the first three years and thereafter increased to six hundred and eighty five students, upon proof of compliance with the CU for three consecutive years. 4/26/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 9/27/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners B. 180351 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2016000197  --  DISTRICT: 06  --  APPLICANT: WRC PROPERTIES, ET AL.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANTS SEEK TO MODIFY A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DEVELOPMENT ORDER (DO) FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL IMPACT (DRI) TO ALLOW FOR A SIMULTANEOUS DECREASE AND ADDITION OF NEW USES FOR THE DRI DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, AND TO EXTEND THE BUILD-OUT DATE OF THE PROJECT.

Suarez Seconder: Daniella Levine Cava Vote: 12 - 0 Absent: Heyman REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Regulatory and Economic Resources Department, read the foregoing proposed item into the record and noted there were two protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Simon Ferro, 600 Brickell Avenue, Miami, FL, counsel for Mini-Warehouse of Kendall, LTD with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation identified the location of the subject parcel and provided a brief review of the foregoing application. Mr. Rick Ruiz, Partner Associate at Marrero and Associates Architects, noted that the projectï¿½s design was consistent with the Downtown Kendall Urban District guidelines and regulations.  He reviewed key design elements such as parking, liners and infill. Mr. Richard Garcia, Richard Garcia & Associates, Inc., (Traffic Engineering Consultants), 8065 NW 98th Street, Miami, FL, provided a brief overview of the traffic analysis performed at the subject site, including the results of the trip generation analysis and comparison of the trips generated by the Lindsley Lumber.  He noted access to the subject site was limited to SW 67th Avenue with no traffic travelling westbound on SW 84th Street. Mr. Ferro stated pursuant to community discussion, the applicant was willing to install a gate limiting access to the subject site along SW 84th Street. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Coconut Grove, Miami, appeared on behalf of the Red Road/Snapper Creek Homeowners Association and private homeowners Ms. Ariana Narciso (6270 SW 85th Street, Miami, FL) and Mr. John Meltzer (8400 SW 63rd Place, Miami, FL).  He advised the Board that his clients objected to the termination of the existing declaration of restrictive covenants which currently governed the entrance and exit of the subject site; and noted the community was concerned about the projectï¿½s impact on traffic and the communityï¿½s quality of life.  Mr. Gibbs argued against the termination of the covenant and requested the Board require the applicant provide a ï¿½construction planï¿½ which would prohibit construction vehicles from travelling through the neighborhood as a condition of approval. Chairman Bovo opened the public hearing and the following speakers appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.\tCity of South Miami Commissioner Bob Welsh, 7437 SW 64th Court, Miami, FL 2.\tMs. Ana Palmer, 6160 SW 84th Street, Miami, FL 3.\tMs. Emma Mufraggi, 5830 SW 85th Street, Miami, FL 4.\tMs. Monica Atkins, address exempt 5.\tMr. Richard Mattaway, 6485 SW 84th Street, Miami, FL 6.\tMs. Cristina Toffoli, 8400 SW 62nd Place, Miami, FL 7.\tMs. Carolina Pellaya-White, 5900 SW 83rd Street, Miami, FL 8.\tMr. Ben Olson, 6200 SW 86th Street, Miami, FL 9.\tMr. Camilo Rosales, 5710 SW 84th Street, South Miami, FL 10.\tMs. Debbie Lang, 5941 SW 86th Street, Miami, FL 11.\tMs. Sylvia Gubbins, 6250 SW 84th Street, Miami, FL 12.\tMr. Jan Dijs, 6435 SW 85th Street, Miami, FL 13.\tMs. Shelby Lash, 8377 SW 62nd Avenue, South Miami, FL 14.\tMs. Christiana Serle, 7650 SW 59th Court, South Miami, FL 15.\tMs. Kimber Mariani, 5850 SW 84th Street, Miami, FL 16.\tMs. Silvia Portuondo, 8325 SW 62nd Place, Miami, FL 17.\tMs. Martha Villabona, 6255 SW 85th Street, Miami, FL 18.\tMs. Giselle Macias, 8205 SW 63rd Court, Miami, FL 19.\tMr. Nick Cockshutt, 6366 SW 85th Street, Miami, FL 20.\tMs. Kemelly Figueroa, 8125 SW 62nd Place, South Miami, FL 21.\tMr. Henry Bolz III, 6263 Snapper Creek Drive, Miami, FL 22.\tMr. Alex Sicilia, 6111 SW 86th Street, Miami, FL 23.\tMs. Annette Onorati, 8335 SW 62nd Place, Miami, FL 24.\tMr. Kevin Love, 5861 SW 84th Street, Miami, FL Seeing no one else wishing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Mr. Ferro stated instead of rescinding and revoking Resolution Z-220-87 as previously requested and outlined in Request No. 1 of the item, the applicant was now seeking to modify Resolution Z-220-87.  He noted while the applicant was sensitive to the communityï¿½s concerns, the project had to comply with the Downtown Kendall Urban District guidelines and regulations and stressed the project did not violate the Comprehensive Master Development Plan (CDMP). Mr. Ferro reiterated the applicantï¿½s request for limited access to SW 84th Street and argued there was legislation in place which would allow full access. Revisiting the PowerPoint presentation, Mr. Ferro spoke about the traffic protections afforded to the community by the existing road infrastructure and compared the protections to those seen in private communities.  He pointed out all roads in question were public and advocated for a balance between the rights of the residential community and the right of the applicant for limited access at SW 84th Street.  Mr. Ferro noted there were three residential units which abut SW 84th Street and whose residents currently park inside the applicantï¿½s building. Mr. Ferro objected to the proposed restriction of construction vehicles usage of SW 84th Street and reiterated the applicant was requesting limited access to SW 84th Street which would allow only tenants and employees of the development access to the street. Commissioner Suarez requested clarification from Mr. Gibbs as to his clientsï¿½ objection to the application. Mr. Gibbs reiterated his clients objected to the termination of the existing declaration of restrictive covenants which currently governed the entrance and exit of the subject site. Commissioner Suarez moved to deny Request No. 2 and proposed amending the item to include language which would limit construction vehicle access to the neighborhood. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel suggested imposing a separate condition of approval (Condition No. 11) which would limit access of construction vehicles along SW 84th for the initial construction of the townhouses. Both Mr. Ferro and Mr. Gibbs accepted the proffered amendment. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion before the Board was as follows: ~\tA modified approval of Request No. 1 for rescission and revocation of Resolution 4-ZAB-317-93 and CZAB12-18-00 to delete Condition Nos. 1 through 4 of Resolution Z-220-87 while retaining the special exception approval for the self-storage and subject to the new conditions with site plan; ~\tA modified approval of Request No. 2 to approve the deletion of all of the terms of the covenant except the provision limiting  entry and exit to the subject property to the west side of SW 67th Avenue with no openings along SW 84th Street; ~\tImpose Condition No. 11 limiting access of construction vehicles along SW 84th Street for the initial townhouse construction; ~\tRequire the new site plan to be in compliance with restrictions along SW 84th Street as detailed in Condition No. 2; ~\tAmend Condition No. 2  to include language which would allow for approval of the plan, the same be substantially in accordance with that submitted for the hearing entitled ï¿½A+ Mini Storageï¿½ by Marrero and Associates , Architects and Planners, Inc; except as may be modified to remove openings along SW 84th Street. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Diaz and Mr. Gibbs regarding the road closures. Commissioner Diaz inquired about the closing/barricading a road. Ms. Darlene Fernandez, Assistant Director for Miami-Dade Countyï¿½s Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) Traffic Engineering and Traffic Signals Division, reviewed the traffic flow modification procedure utilized by the County for closing/opening roads.  She noted that the Boardï¿½s approval was needed only for County roads. Responding to Commissioner Diazï¿½s question as to whether SW 84th Street and SW 67th Avenue were County roads, Ms. Fernandez confirmed that SW 67th Avenue was a County road. Commissioner Diaz noted the subject property was located in a commercial area and asked whether staff recommended approval of the application. Mr. Kogon reviewed staffï¿½s recommendation for approval with conditions including the deletion of the covenant. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Diaz and Mr. Kogon regarding the existing covenant restrictions as it pertained to SW 84th Street. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained the timeframe and noted access limitation was at the Boardï¿½s discretion. . Commissioner Diaz questioned the communityï¿½s objection to allowing access to construction vehicles for the duration of the construction period. Mr. Gibbs clarified the residents opposed construction vehicles such as cranes utilizing SW 84th Street for the construction of the seven story structure. Mr. Ferro spoke about the challenges in monitoring and enforcing construction traffic restrictions along SW 84th Street and argued the literal translation of the covenant as it pertained to openings to SW 84th Street. Commissioner Diaz recognized the concerns of the residents regarding the potential for increased traffic along SW 84th Street if access was allowed and questioned whether the current covenant would prohibit the construction of the townhomes along SW 84th Street. Mr. Kogon clarified staffï¿½s interpretation of the covenant limited openings for vehicular traffic and confirmed the homes located across the street from the subject property currently had vehicular access to SW 84th Street. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Diaz and Mr. Gibbs regarding the residentsï¿½ opposition to providing the applicant access to SW 84th Street when the residents themselves benefited from this access. Mr. Kogon stated staff had no issues with the residential units fronting SW 84th Street. Mr. Ferro pointed out the parking designated for the townhomes would be located inside the development and commented on the importance of allowing residents access to SW 84th Street.  He reiterated the access to SW 84th Street would be limited to tenants and employees. Responding to Commissioner Diazï¿½ question as to whether the roadways in question were public roads, Mr. Kogon confirmed that SW 67th Avenue was a County road, while SW 84th Street was a local road. Ms. Fernandez clarified that both SW 67th Avenue and SW 84th Street were County roads and reviewed the road closure process. Commissioner Sosa inquired whether there was any noise restrictions imposed on the development, particularly the open aired rooftop area. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the development would be subject to the noise regulations enforced by the police. Commissioner Sosa commented on the need to maintain the quality of life for area residents.  She said she did not believe it was fair to close streets and commented on limited street access issues. In response to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s question about prohibiting construction vehicles in the residential R-1 Zoning district, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reported it was a policy call.  He said the policy could be written either to not limit construction trucks relating to the townhouses or to not limit construction trucks at any time. Commissioner Sosa stated there should be designated hours of operation for construction work.  She said that on-street parking was not private parking and should be available to the public. Commissioner Sosa commented on parking issues near her District office where tenants parked in the residential areas because of insufficient parking.   She said she preferred to review the amount of parking requested for the townhouses to ensure they could enter the private parking facilities and did not park in the middle of the streets. Commissioner Sosa said she wanted limited access for residents with private parking as well as a total review of the improper barricades on County roads.  She noted there should also be a traffic study. Commissioner Levine Cava indicated she was familiar with the area and would travel on SW 84th Street if there was no barrier.  She said there was a bottleneck which took an additional 15 minutes to travel four blocks from Kendall Drive to US1.  Commissioner Levine Cava stated the barrier made the neighborhood viable for a number of years, noting cars should not rule development decisions.   She said the County should look at transit oriented development alternatives to deal with congestion and the only traffic solution was fewer cars on the road, not making more pathways and ruining more neighborhoods. Commissioner Levine Cava reported the District was created to be part of the Downtown Kendall Urban District standard.   She said it was not safe to walk from this neighborhood to the Dadeland North Metrorail Station, noting there were no safe crosswalks across SW 67th Avenue, US1 and the Turnpike access road.  Commissioner Levine Cava noted looking at the Downtown Kendall Urban District; there were no other area of residents in the immediate proximity to that district.  She recognized the efforts made by Downtown Kendall to create a transit oriented development including ensuring appropriate density and creating a transit hub. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question whether the barrier could become part of the covenant, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the developer was responsible to ensure the public streets remained open.   He pointed out while covenants about access or site configuration usually addressed what was on the applicantï¿½s property; in this case since the barricade was on public property, the applicant could apply for the street closure through the public works process. Commissioner Levine Cava commented while the CDMP was designed to protect the integrity of neighborhoods she was concerned about vehicular traffic impeding safe neighborhood efforts and future density increase applications. Commissioner Edmonson questioned whether the row houses would be on SW 84th Street and what types of properties surrounded the site. Mr. Kogon confirmed the row houses would be on SW 84th Street.  He informed the Board that there were duplexes (RU-2 Zoning) across the street; commercial property to the West and North; multi-family to the East; and single family homes about one block to the East. Commissioner Edmonson inquired about property access and resident parking to which Mr. Kogon stated the current street closure prevented connection between SW 84th Street and SW 67th Avenue.  Mr. Kogon pointed out the front units could be accessed on SW 84th Street by an internal ingress and egress. Commissioner Diaz spoke about the road closure process and argued residents did not want additional traffic on SW 84th Street.  He pointed out cars were currently parked in house driveways across the street of the subject property as well as the existence of street parking. Mr. Ferro stated the area mentioned by Commissioner Diaz was private property which did not allow other access and clarified the main entrance was located on SW 67th Avenue with an ancillary access at SW 84th Street. Mr. Gibbs pointed out the applicant never requested the SW 84th Street access point to be opened in the twenty years of property ownership. Commissioner Diaz stated one entrance/exit was insufficient for the proposed development and making the barricades legal could maintain the autonomy of the neighborhood in the future. Commissioner Sosa commented on the benefits of opening access on SW 84th Street to the development.  She pointed out cars currently drove illegally on SW 84th Street even though it was closed to traffic and expressed concern that the situation could worsen upon completion of the development. Commissioner Sosa asked Assistant County Attorney Kerbel to prepare legislation directing the Administration to determine whether closed roads throughout the County were done with proper permits and processes. Commissioner Levine Cava suggested a separate motion requesting the barrier removal along SW 84th Street be brought back to the Board for consideration. Commissioner Suarez stated Commissioner Sosaï¿½s request applied to a review of all barriers that did not go through the correct process.  He noted this legislation exempted the project from the requirements; prohibiting such closures. In response to Commissioner Diazï¿½ concern, Commissioner Suarez questioned whether a driveway opening into a garage along SW 64th Avenue would be precluded. Mr. Kogon advised a driveway or access drive into the site was precluded and noted there were townhomes fronting onto the road with on-street parking but no driveways. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion before the Board was as follows: ~\tModified approval of Request No. 1 to preserve the initial special exception in Z-220-87, but to delete all other conditions and to delete the subsequent modifications; ~\tModified approval of Request No. 2 to eliminate all terms of the covenants except for the prohibition on access and openings on SW 84th Street; ~\tModified Proposed Condition No. 2 to specify the site plan may be modified to remove openings along SW 84th Street; and ~\tAdd new Condition No. 11 to only permit construction vehicles necessary for initial townhouse construction along SW 84th Street. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion approved the application except for property access restrictions and construction vehicle restrictions on SW 84th Street. It was moved by Commissioner Suarez that the foregoing proposed motion be approved as amended.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan. In response to Commissioner Martinezï¿½ request, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the barrier remained in its current configuration and the applicant would not be required to open the barrier. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out the Public Works Department or the Board could still take different action as to SW 87th Street access. Mr. Kogon further clarified the motion, providing a visual overview of proposed property entrances, parking and access to the four residential units. Commissioner Jordan withdrew her second to the motion. The foregoing proposed motion presented by Commissioner Suarez failed due to the lack of a second. It was subsequently moved by Commissioner Diaz to approve the application as presented with the modified approval of Request No. 1 to preserve the initial special exception in Resolution Z-220-87, but to delete all other conditions and to delete the subsequent modifications. The foregoing proposed motion presented by Commissioner Diaz failed due to the lack of a second. Commissioner Levine Cava stated she would offer a second to Commissioner Suarezï¿½s initial motion if re-introduced. It was then moved by Commissioner Suarez that his original motion be re-introduced and approved as amended.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Levine Cava. Commissioner Martinez mentioned there was no way to enforce construction trucks not using SW 84th Street. Mr. Gibbs stated Commissioner Suarezï¿½ proposed motion was acceptable while Mr. Ferro voiced his objection to the motion. Mr. Ferro noted the applicant was requesting a gate on SW 84th Street with exclusive access to only eight percent of the people living and working in the development.  He explained the applicant proposed providing limited access to residents and employees of the developmentï¿½s offices and commercial space but would not grant access to customers renting storage space.  Mr. Ferro concurred with Commissioner Martinez that there was no way to effectively monitor and prohibit construction vehicles from using SW 84th Street. Mr. Gibbs commented on emergency vehicle access, noting he accepted the proposed inclusion of SW 84th Street access to employees and individuals owning townhouses. It was moved by Commissioner Suarez that the foregoing proposed motion be approved with the following amendments: ~\tModified approval of Request No. 1 to preserve the initial special exception in Z-220-87, but to delete all other conditions and to delete the subsequent modifications; ~\tModified approval of Request No. 2 to eliminate all terms of the covenants except for the prohibition on access and openings on SW 84th Street; ~\tModified Proposed Condition No. 2 to specify the site plan may be modified to remove openings along SW 84th Street; ~\tAdd new Condition No. 11 to only permit construction vehicles necessary for initial townhouse construction along SW 84th Street; and ~\tAllow SW 84th Street limited access to emergency vehicles as well as development employees and individuals owning townhouses, excluding storage space tenants. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Levine Cava. Commissioner Monestime stated although he arrived late, he listened to the beginning of the discussion of this item from his office. Commissioner Sosa expressed concern regarding the inability to monitor and enforce the condition restricting construction equipment along SW 84th Street and suggested omitting Condition No. 11. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion, noting a new covenant would need to be provided showing the access changes to SW 84th Street. There being no further questions or comments, the Board, by motion duly made, seconded and carried, approved the application, as amended. 5/3/2018 Deferred by the Board of County Commissioners 11/15/2018 Deferred by the Zoning Board CURRENT: 1. 182825 Zoning HEARING NO.

Ms. Silvia Llorca, 1433 Monroe Street, Hollywood, FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, 88 Biscayne Management LLC, and reviewed the applicantï¿½s plans for the subject site. Seeing no one else wishing to speak, Chairman Bovo closed the public hearing. Commissioner Edmonson noted while she supported the application, she objected to the non-use variance request to allow forty four parking spaces instead of the forty five currently permitted, particularly in light of the parking issues facing the area. Ms. Llorca explained there was insufficient space available to build forty five parking spaces. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Edmonson and Ms. Llorca regarding the parking issues facing the existing community. Mr. Kogon explained the configuration of the subject site would make it difficult to fit the forty fifth parking spot and reiterated staffï¿½s support was based on the circumstances surrounding the requested parking space decrease. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to approve staffï¿½s recommendation. ADJOURNMENT All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s meeting were transferred to the care, custody and control of the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-1-19 Mover: Rebeca Sosa Seconder: Xavier L. Suarez Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Moss , Souto , Martinez , Diaz REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources Department read into the record Agenda Items No. 1, Legislative File No. 190122, noting one protest and no waivers; Agenda Item No. 2, Legislative File No. 190123, noting no protests and no waivers; Agenda Item No. 3, Legislative File No. 190124, noting one protest and no waivers; and Agenda Item No. 4, Legislative File No. 190125, noting no protests and no waivers. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing. Mr. Jose Gonzalez, Executive Vice President, Florida East Coast Industries (FECI), 111 NE 1 Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board, noting all applications applied to the vision for the Ludlam Trail.  Mr. Gonzalez stated that the County now owned the Ludlam Trail and todayï¿½s (1/24) legislation dealt with implementation of applicable development node zoning.  He acknowledged Commissioners Sosa and Suarez for their leadership in moving this effort forward.  Mr. Gonzalez said the goal was to allow redevelopment of older industrial areas, noting the Ludlam Trail master development plan would come later. Mr. Joseph Goldstein, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board on Application Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  He described the timeline and major steps toward the Countyï¿½s acquisition of the Ludlam Trail.   Mr. Goldstein indicated that the County purchased most of the Ludlam Trail and also received easements for areas it did not purchase.  He said this legislation dealt with Ludlam Trail and its nodes. Mr. Goldstein described development nodes at Tamiami Trail, Coral Way and Bird Road.  He said there were no nodes between Miller Drive and Dadeland or North of the Tamiami Trail.  Mr. Goldstein noted this was a legacy project to be proud of for many years into the future. He proceeded to describe the three applications, noting they were relatively small parcels that needed a significant boost offered by the Ludlam Trail.  He mentioned efforts to comply with CDMP covenants limiting traffic and the comprehensive Ludlam Trail zoning ordinance that was being addressed.  Mr. Goldstein indicted that development would adhere to the guiding principles of not creating densities next to single family residences to ensure there would be no impacts upon adjacent residents.  He noted County staff recommended approval of Application Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and urged the Board to approve these applications consistent with staffï¿½s recommendations. Mr. Hugo Arza, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board on Agenda Item No. 4.  Mr. Arza described the property and acknowledged staff for their approval recommendation and mutual efforts to implement the zoning district.  He reported that the property was less than three acres and that a declaration of restrictions limiting density to 313 units and 10,000 square feet of retail space was offered during the land use process and would be adhered to during project development.  Mr. Arza noted this was currently a vacant infill site needing development alongside the Ludlam Trail.  He stated the applicant intended to develop a mixed use project in line with the Declaration of Restrictions with multi-family residential units and retail noting it was designed to enhance the Ludlam Trail.  Mr. Arza acknowledged Commissioners Sosa and Suarez for their ongoing efforts and asked for the Boardï¿½s approval. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WERE SWORN IN BY THE CLERK PRIOR TO PRESENTING TESTIMONY. Rebecca Valera, 1222 SW 74 Avenue, Miami, stated that the area already had two parks and did not need another one.  She mentioned problems associated with buildings over one story; including sun blockage as well as more people, traffic, crime, noise and inadequate parking that would overflow to adjacent area.  Ms. Valera asked that the area remained as is with multi-family single story homes and apartments. Ms. Eleanor Quigley, 3470 SW 75 Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board as the Waterway Neighborhood Association (Waterway) President.  She pointed out that the Ludlam Trail ran one mile out of the 6.2 miles through the middle of the Waterway neighborhood, between Bird Road and Coral Way.  Ms. Quigley stated that the Ludlam Trail would benefit from the creation of a Corridor District and offer a greater variety of amenities.   She expressed the desire that any additional tax revenue associated with the Ludlam Trail be designated toward future trail development.  Ms. Quigley expressed concern over the loss of the Ludlam Branch Post Office and the desire that there were plans to replace it.  She stated that all applications on the West side of the Ludlam Trail should be approved for Corridor District and noted opposition to the proposed access road at SW 44th Street from the residential East side of the Trail.  Ms. Quigley asked the Board not to allow commercial developers to open up dead end streets into residential areas and to keep commercial traffic within commercial areas and mixed uses within the Bird Road Art District.  She submitted an area map and comments as an Exhibit into the record. Mr. Joseph Compel, Jr., 6751 SW 38 Street, Miami, appeared before the Board in opposition of Agenda Item No. 2 (4), noting this provision deleted a Declaration of Restrictions.  He mentioned the Board previously recommended the neighbors to meet with builders and work out a resolution to their objections.  Mr. Compel said multi-family construction already overburdened the neighborhood with too much traffic and inadequate parking.  He indicated the Ludlam Trail should not be used to allow builders to revert to previous provision to which objections were already resolved.  Mr. Compel said the restrictions did not impact the use of the Ludlam Trail or its aesthetics. Mr. James Quigley, 3470 SW 75 Avenue, Miami, proceeded to present conditions needing to be met for approval of the Mendez property applications as part of the Corridor District complex (see Exhibit submitted by Ms. Eleanor Quigley). Ms. Garine Berberian, 3100 SW 69 Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board noting concern regarding re-zoning the property behind her home to Corridor District.  She said there was a three story maximum height covenant when the home was purchased and now the height could go to six stories or higher, noting concern this would lead to increased traffic and parking issues in an already congested area.   Ms. Berberian mentioned the Ludlam Trail was an asset; however, expressed opposition to single family homes suffering and the negative quality of life impact.  She suggested having gradual height restriction requirements behind single family homes with larger properties adjacent to intersections. Ms. Maggie Duque, 7500 SW 69 Court, Miami, commented that the Ludlam Trail would be a beautiful place for bikers and walkers with nature and trees.  She stated that the County was increasing the number of buildings and density daily and wanted to ensure quality of life issues were not forgotten over private interests.  Ms. Duque supported the original vision of having a peaceful trail considering the greater good of the community. Mr. Phil Berberian, 4100 SW 69 Avenue, Miami, appeared before the Board noting he was looking forward to the Ludlam Trail.  He said the covenant on the land should be preserved limiting the building height behind single family residences and the previous Charrettes reported there would be no developments behind those homes.  Mr. Berberian requested the preservation of the terms of the covenants limiting construction height.  He asked the Board to consider the adverse impact on single family homes close to the Bird Road node. Mr. Gonzalez clarified that the buffering of single family homes on the Southeast side of Bird Road was contemplated in the plan. Mr. Cesar Garcia Ponce, Florida East Coast Industries, 111 NE 1 Avenue, Miami, reported on development access to the property on SW 44th Street from the residential project on the East side and no access on the West side, other than for emergency and service vehicles.  He noted buffering would remain at least 30 feet away from single family homes. Chairwoman Edmonson noted there were five Speakerï¿½s Cards against the proposals that did not speak. Seeing no one further wanting to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Commissioner Sosa stated that 11,000 residents adjacent to the area received notices about this project; that several town hall meetings were held with 400 to 500 people in attendance; and that charrettes were scheduled.  She said the public requested what we are looking at today.  Commissioner Sosa stated that zoning existed that would allow FECI to build up to two story houses and commercial development along the nodes.  She described the process of working with residents to help preserve the residential areas.   Commissioner Sosa indicated that the only impact to the Waterways would be to walk a few blocks to enter the Ludlam Trail.  She mentioned this legislation was the dream of the residents.  Commissioner Sosa stated that FECI was kind in selling the property to the County and helping to preserve the Ludlam Trail. Commissioner Sosa said the Ludlam Trail would become a community legacy and connect to the Underline.  She pointed out that funding was received to maintain the Ludlam Trail; that funds were set aside for the Ludlam Trail construction; and that funding would allocated for safety matters.  Commissioner Sosa said she would not allow more than five stories in the commercial and industrial areas and all residential areas would be preserved.  She reported that traffic would be better because people no longer needed to stop at traffic lights, noting the elevation will allow people to walk without disrupting traffic.  Commissioner Sosa advised that there would be future meetings to review the project. Commissioner Suarez mentioned that he concurred with residents desires that the Ludlam Trail be for pedestrians and bikers, not for parks.  He inquired whether the nodes were owned by the developer or the County; whether there was an easement that would allow the County to elevate trail across the main intersections if funding was obtained; and whether we were encouraging the developer to build a ramp that would go from the City of Miami to 80th Street. Mr. Kogon responded affirmatively to the questions asked by Commissioner Suarez.  He added that as part of the zoning application and subsequent site plans, the developer was being asked to put in the infrastructure so that they can link to the bridge. Commissioner Suarez commented on the importance of connectivity, noting his colleagues should seek the additional funding from Tallahassee.  He congratulated Commissioner Sosa and staff for their continued efforts. Commissioner Sosa said this was not an easy endeavor.  She recognized Mr. Gonzalez for his willingness to see this project become a reality.  Commissioner Sosa said this project was to create a better future for our community and its residents.  She acknowledged everyone for their participation; including the County Attorneyï¿½s Office, the Mayorï¿½s Office, County Administration, Commissioner Suarez and community residents. Commissioner Levine Cava acknowledged Commissioners Sosa and Suarez for carrying this dream forward.  She asked for clarification on building height and private road access restrictions. Mr. Kogon indicated that the maximum height in the nodes was six stories; that the previous nine story approval was now a six story structure on the North side (Application No. 2); that the zoning code required a maximum eight foot wall to protect residents to the East as well as landscaping; that a thirty foot buffer was required for six story construction; and that a two story building could be placed further to the East.  In terms of the private road, Mr. Kogan reported on a private road entrance at SW 44th Street into the community which also acts as part of the buffer.  He added that commercial traffic would only traverse through the Ludlam Trail at existing public roads and does not promote any more traffic. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote to approve staff recommendations. 2 190123 Zoning PH NO. Z18-035 -- DISTRICT(S) 7 -- APPLICANT: MANUEL J.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Motion to deny Zoning Z-9-19 Mover: Xavier L. Suarez Seconder: Daniella Levine Cava Vote: 8 - 4 No: Heyman , Sosa , Souto , Diaz Absent: Higgins REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory an Economic Resources, read the item into the record. Mr. Allen Krischer, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared on behalf of the appellant, JDP Equities, LLC to request approval for a mixed use development with residential, retail and an office center in Kings Creek Village.  He announced staff recommended approval of the application and noted it was consistent with the comprehensive plan and meets all of the criteria of the zoning codes.  Mr. Krischer presented a video displaying the context of the townhouse community, subject property, quad-plex and nearby multi-family buildings.  He reported the subject property consist of 4.3 acres located at 87th avenue and Kings Creek Boulevard and noted it was zoned ï¿½BU1ï¿½.  Mr. Krischer advised the existing center was leased to mixed retail tenants and he pointed out the retail center was built in the 1970ï¿½s; noting it was close to fifty years old and stated the owners have decided to make an investment to renew this center.  He advised the original proposal was introduced in 2016, with plans to build an assisted living facility (ALF) as a mixed use project with retail and office space.  Mr. Krischer indicated the retail and office space would be moved to the front of the property and the ALF located in the back of the property.  After discussion with the neighbors the developers reworked the plan and eliminated the ALF component and added upscale residential housing with fifty-four units. He advised subsequent discussions were held with the neighbors and this plan was also opposed by the neighbors who were now concerned with the size and the variances.   Mr. Krischer informed the Board after conducting several meetings and making three amendments to the proposal; there was a substantial amount of opposition from the neighbors.  He announced the current proposal switched the buildings inward; reduced the height of the buildings to no more than forty-two feet(42); commercial square footage was also reduced by 5,000 square feet; reduction in units to forty-nine(49) and added green space.  Mr. Krischer stated the applicant was proposing a mixed use project with retail and office component on the north along Kings Creek Drive to create a streetscape.  He specified the retail office space has been moved to Kings Creek Drive, they have addressed the street scape, provided protected colonnades for pedestrian use and access, eliminated the driveway to the commercial center and proposed two green spaces and placed the parking in the interior of the site.  In reference to the residential units, Mr. Krischer explained the applicant proposed three story townhouses with a total of forty-nine (49) units which were compatible with the scale and size of the existing neighborhoods. Mr. Tim Hyman 15469 SW 147 Street, Miami, reported neighborhood data was collected via door to door efforts and he submitted seventy-seven petitions in support of this application.  He noted an additional twenty-five petitions were not surrendered due to neighbors being afraid of including their names on the record. Mr. Krischer declared this project was intended to provide goods and services to the Kings Creek community and pointed out this site was planned and zoned for business and office use. He opined the application should be approved because it was consistent with the comprehensive plan, staff determined the application was consistent with Miami-Dade County Code criteria and it was viewed as an opportunity to integrate additional shops, offices, restaurants and services into a high-density area. Mr. Krischer justified the importance of developing this location and expounded on the goals of the County to increase walkability and density in the Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan transportation corridors and urged the Board to approve this application. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to public comments and the following persons appeared in support of the application: Mr. Lawrence Percival, 11945 SW 127th Court, Miami, FL Mr. Blas Elias, 8500 SW 86 Court, Miami, FL Mr. Rafael Pereira, 7840 Camino Real, Miami, FL Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Miami, appeared on behalf of Kings Creek Village Association and urged the Board to deny this application since it was inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, contrary to the standards and zoning code and incompatible with the Kings Creek community. He specified the following ten development approvals being requested by applicant for this project: 1.  \tChange the rezoning from ï¿½BUï¿½ to ï¿½ BU1Aï¿½ 2.  \tSpecial Assessment to add residential use on a commercial site 3.  \tSix non-use variances increasing the floor area ratio from .73 to 1.01 4.  \tReduce the commercial setbacks on the North and the South 5.  \tReduce the commercial setbacks on the East 6.  \tReduce the residential setback on the South 7.  \tReduce the residential setback to the East 8.  \tReduce the residential setback adjacent to the parking garage 9.  \tModify the site plan to include these changes 10. \tModify the covenant to allow administrative changes without mailed notice to neighbors Mr. Gibbs noted after several efforts made by the applicant to reduce the size, the project remained massive and out of scale with the surrounding neighborhood; which made it inconsistent with the provisions of the comprehensive plan.  He advised the current adjacent property was two stories tall and the project proposed four story buildings and he added the actual development intensity measures in square footage would increase from 45,000 to 188,000 square feet.  Mr. Gibbs indicated the height and intensity of the project were out of character for the surrounding neighborhood, the development would detrimentally impact adjacent areas and stated the project did not provide a sensitive well designed transition to adjacent residential areas as required in the business and office land use.  He stated land use policy 4C required that residential areas shall be protected from intrusion by uses that would degrade the health, safety, tranquility, character and overall welfare of the community by creating impacts such as excessive density or intensity.   Mr. Gibbs reported this urban project was too big and too intense for a long stable neighborhood and urged the Board to deny this application. Mr. Henry Iler, 200 S Biscayne Blvd. Suite 2790 Miami, expert urban planner for the Kings Creek Community reiterated the issues mentioned by Mr. Gibbs and mentioned the proposed plan was not consistent with the following comprehensive development masterplan policies: LU4A, LU4C, LU4D, LU9D and LU9E.  He reported the current project was below the approved ï¿½FARï¿½ and provided the following substantiating information: ï¿½\t320% increase in the ï¿½FARï¿½ ï¿½\tSite development increase of 143,712 square feet above the existing commercial center ï¿½\t17 feet height increase ï¿½\t90% decrease in the setback of the buildings ï¿½\t83% decrease in the rear setback ï¿½\t80% decrease on eastside ï¿½\tLandscape buffering would be removed ï¿½\t26% greater traffic impact for AM peak hours ï¿½\t54% greater traffic impact for PM peak hours ï¿½\t48% average daily traffic impact Mr. Iler specified the proposed redevelopment plan was inconsistent with the business and office land use and not in conformity with the comprehensive plan. The following speakers appeared in opposition to the application: Mr. Luis Valdes, 8206 SW 82 Court, Miami, FL Ms. Lourdes Rodriguez, 8201 SW 82 Court, Miami, FL Ms. Marelu Essig, 8140 SW 82 Place, Miami, FL Mr. Alfredo Manrara, 8205 SW 82 Court, Miami, FL Mr. Joseph M.

Mr. Krischer replied to the compatibility issues mentioned by opposing counsel and noted the proposed uses were compatible with the current buildings on the property and was permitted according to this zoning district.  He pointed out staff concluded this project was a pedestrian and transit friendly development and opined in order for change to occur, the County must make changes to existing neighborhoods and approve applications of this nature to increase density. Commissioner Suarez reported this item was heard at the Community Council and received a vote of 5-0 against the application.  He also read into the record the findings made of the Council Chairman listed on page 117 of these proceedings; and based on those facts he moved to deny the appeal. Discussion ensued between the Board members and staff regarding the current allowances for the site versus the future proposals. Based on several questions raised regarding the covenants, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel proclaimed the applicant was not required to obtain the approval of the home owners association under the existing covenants to seek zoning approval from this Board.  After further dialogue, the Board proceeded to vote on the denial of the application.

He explained the design preserved and enhanced the full perimeter of the site to move vehicles around which included the 1300 linear feet of storage capacity on site. Mr. Joe Cordina, 4055 NW 97 Ave, Miami, Certified Urban Planner, discussed the specifics of the traffic cueing and compatibility issues pertaining to this development.

He mentioned the private covenant which required the applicant to build an eight foot barrier wall, provide landscaping along SW 70th Street and cover the cost of traffic combing devices and signage was given to the County Attorneyï¿½s office for record purposes. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell revealed the private covenant was not enforceable by this Board, but noted the commitments made by the applicant to pay for combing devices could be added to the conditions in the approval of this resolution.

Mr. Harvey Vasquez, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, FL appeared on behalf of the applicant, and advised this was a 19.56 acre parcel located at the southwest (SW) corner of SW 260 Street and SW 137 Avenue. Mr. Vasquez announced the property was located in the Naranja Community Urban Center District (NCUCD) and the applicant requested to amend the property from residential (R) to residential modified (RM).  He also noted this property was the subject of an administrative site plan (ASPR) review, application # 2018-00025 and was pending based on the outcome of this hearing.  Mr. Vazquez advised that application was for approximately 350 units, but based on Ordinance 18-124 for increased densities in the urban centers, properties located within the edge sub-district of urban centers could be developed at a maximum height of six stories and up to forty-five (45) units per acre.  He stated an approval of this application would allow for residential development up to 885 units and six stories; however the applicant has submitted a declaration of restrictions limiting the density to 468 units and limiting the height of the development to a maximum of four stories for those properties abutting single family and duplex residences to the west and east.  Mr. Vasquez pointed out that staff recommended approval of the re-designation of the subject property from ï¿½Rï¿½ to ï¿½RMï¿½ and staff also indicated the re-designation furthers the vision of the future development of the county.  He mentioned approval of this application would continue along the path of the ASPR process with the increased density and requested approval of the Board.

He mentioned crime in the area and the potential for increased rates as a result of this rental development.  Mr. Rodriguez opined the project was too big for this area and lacked good infrastructure. Seeing no other persons wishing to appear to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the floor to public comment. Commissioner Moss agreed with the comments made by Mr. Rodriguez regarding crime in the area, but noted he encouraged high density development in his district to get as many residents as possible along the transit way and to also alleviate pressure off the urban boundary line. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel clarified the item was approved per staffï¿½s recommendations which reference the covenant proffered by the applicant. Commissioner Levine Cava asked staff if this developer would be contributing to the design and completion of wide sidewalks, bike lanes, and other complete street features to facilitate connectivity to the transit system and bicycle trails. Mr. Kogon explained the beauty of the urban center was built within the zoning code; requiring the standard roadway design be built with additional width along with the redevelopment of all roadways surrounding their lot.

Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to public comments and the following person appeared in opposition to the application: Ms. Myra Joli, 700 Geronimo Drive Coral Gables, FL Seeing no other persons wishing to appear to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the floor to public comment. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding the process of boundary changes by passing the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB); Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel stated the Board amended the regulations requiring urban centers and applications related to changes or  extensions of urban centers be forwarded directly to this Board. Commissioner Levine Cava opined the residents in Naranja were unaware of this expansion and asked the applicant if they were willing to obtain community input prior to moving forward. Mr. Fernandez announced the proposed boundary changes were consistent with other centers located along the corridor and notices were sent to aboding owners. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed concern with the twelve story height increase and urged the applicant to defer the item to allow for public participation through the zoning process. Mr. Fernandez stated the applicant was willing to defer the application to obtain community feedback. By motion duly made and seconded, this item was deferred to the May 23, 2019 Zoning meeting. 19 ADJOURNMENT REPORT: There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting adjourned at 2:29 p.m. 3 CONSENT AGENDA 9/25/2024 Agenda Key: 4259 Home | Agendas | Minutes | Legislative Search | Lobbyist Registration | Legislative Reports 2024 BCC Meeting Calendar | Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances | ADA Notice | Home | Using Our Site | About | Phone\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDirectory | Privacy | Disclaimer E-mail your comments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions and suggestions to Webmaster Web Site\r\n\t\t\t\t\tï¿½ 2024 Miami-Dade County.

WITHIN THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY (UDB) Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-12-19 Mover: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Jordan , Monestime , Cava , Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 93 protests and 305 waivers filed. Mr. Ben Fernandez, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, FL, counsel for Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, Inc., recounted the history of the school and provided a brief summary of the foregoing application.  He explained the applicant was seeking approval to construct a new chapel and make improvements to the lights in the existing sports field.  Mr. Fernandez submitted for the record, 248 letters of support from the community and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation highlighted the proposed chapel location and design.  He noted services were currently held in a cafeteria or outdoors which was not ideal and spoke about the importance of a chapel to the function and mission of the school.  Mr. Fernandez told the Board members that the applicant was seeking two non-use variances, the first to permit a proposed religious facility (chapel) setback of 20 feet from the front property line and setback of 20 feet from the side street property line; and the second to permit the proposed chapel building with a building height of 45 feet.  He pointed out no neighbors would be affected by the location of the chapel since the Tamiami Fire Station and Trail Park were located opposite the south property line and  spoke about the proposed design and architectural details of the chapel specifically the chapel height. Father Guillermo Garcia-Tunon, President of the Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (BJPS), 12725 SW 6th Street, Miami FL, spoke about his familyï¿½s extensive history as alumni of BJPS beginning with his great grandfather who attended and graduated from the original campus located in Havana, Cuba in 1896.  He noted despite immense challenges, including the confiscation and expulsion of the Jesuits from the school by the Castro regime in 1961, the school eventually rebuilt in Miami and continues to operate as a testament to the hard work and dedication of its supporters and alumni.  Father Garcia-Tunon attributed the schoolï¿½s continued success and growth to its foundation as a Catholic Jesuit school and urged the Board to approve the request to construct a new chapel.  He highlighted the importance of the chapel to the schoolï¿½s operation and mission to educate and produce Christian leaders. Mr. Jorge Hernandez, JLH Architect, 337 Palermo Avenue, Coral Gables FL, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, reviewed the schoolï¿½s previous locations beginning with the original campus located in Havana, Cuba.  He pointed out the prominence of the chapel in the architecture of the first building used to house the school in 1854 and highlighted key design elements of the schoolï¿½s second campus built in 1925.  Mr. Hernandez emphasized the importance of verticality in sacred spaces and reviewed the proposed design plans for the new chapel including the proposed location on the subject site.  He reiterated the significance and impact of the applicantï¿½s non-use variances request on the design and appearance of the chapel, specifically the request for the chapel height to exceed the 35 feet maximum currently permitted. Mr. Hernandez argued the height variance request was more than reasonable given the fact the schoolï¿½s existing flight stage was higher than 45 feet and reiterated the importance of verticality in sacred spaces. Mr. Fernandez advised the Board members that the applicant was also seeking approval to add outdoor lighting for the existing sports areas which would allow the school to host games at night and provide athletes the opportunity to practice in the evenings to avoid heat exhaustion.   He identified other private schools located in Miami-Dade County with lit sports fields and commented on the importance of outdoor lighting to fostering school spirit and providing BJPS a similar competitive edge enjoyed by these other schools.  Mr. Fernandez stated while the BJPS originally agreed to no night lights on the sports fields, pursuant to zoning Resolutions No. Z-122-77 and Z-18-09, lighting technology had evolved so much over the years that the light fixtures available now were less bulky and visible and produced more efficient focused lighting with less disruptive glare. Mr. Fernandez published a video of the Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School football field during a night game to illustrate how modern lighting technology illuminated the field without casting a disruptive glare on the surrounding residential area and noted this type of lighting was not available when zoning Resolution No. Z-122-77 was adopted by the Board. Coach Richard Stewart, 6130 SW 27th Street, Miami FL, spoke about the physical impact of daytime practice and play on athletes and pointed out other teams refused to play at BJPS because the fields were not lit.  He added Belen also loses ï¿½home court advantageï¿½ because all playoff games must be played at night pursuant to the Florida High School Athletic Association which negatively affects both the players and supporters.  Coach Stewart concurred with Mr. Fernandezï¿½ representation that most other private schools of similar size were outfitted with night lights and reiterated installing night lights at BJPS would benefit the players and make it more convenient for parents and supporters to attend evening games. Mr. Fernandez reviewed the location of the sport fields and pointed out the perimeters were well buffered with royal palm and mahogany trees.  He noted all lighting must comply with Miami-Dade County Code 33-4.1 which determines the amount of light spillage allowed onto residential areas and restated the applicantï¿½s technical requests.  Mr. Fernandez reported the application was consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the CDMP and satisfied applicable zoning standards and requested the Board approve the application. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.      Mr. Sergio Pernal, 350 SW 125th Avenue, Miami FL 2.     Mr. Orlando Cruz, 21 NW 128th Avenue, Miami FL 3.     Mr. Roger Haradon, 151 SW 129th Avenue, Miami FL, indicated he had filed a petition containing 95 signatures of residents opposing the application. 4.    Ms. Heather Pernas, 350 SW 125th Avenue, Miami FL, questioned whether the people supporting the item actually resided in the neighborhood. 5.    Mr. Manuel Prada, 220 SW 128th Avenue, Miami FL 6.    Ms. Zoraya Prada, 220 SW 128th Avenue, Miami FL Commissioner Sosa acknowledged the presence of Commissioner for City of West Miami, Mr. Eric Diaz-Padron, at todayï¿½s (5/9) meeting. The following persons appeared before the Board to speak in support of the foregoing application: 1.     Mr. Carlos Huembes, 11889 SW 72nd Terrace, Miami FL 2.    Mr. Antonio Castro, 313 Velarde Avenue, Miami FL 3.    Ms. Diane Abou Khalil, 125 NW 128th Avenue, Miami FL 4.    Mr. Joseph Klock Jr., 2555 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, Miami FL 5.    Mr. Doumit Shmouni, 125 NW 128th Avenue, Miami FL 6.    Mr. Sebastian Rou, Senior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (address exempt), spoke about the dangers of heat exhaustion and explained how installation of night lights on the sports field would positively impact athletics and foster school spirit.   He noted building a chapel on the premises would provide the students a place to worship together and encourage spiritual growth. 7.    Mr. Manuel Garcia-Tunon, 6945 Almansa Street, Coral Gables FL 8.    Mr. Joseph Gonzalez, 7521 SW 57th Terrace, Miami FL 9.    Mr. Alejandro Salas, 6500 Sunset Drive, Miami FL, waved in support. 10.  Mr. John Santamaria, 2821 Coacoochee Street, Coconut Grove FL 11.  Mr. Robert Curbelo III, Senior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (address exempt) 12.  Mr. Carlos Huembes, Jr., Senior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (address exempt) 13.  Mr. Donald Chaney, Junior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (address exempt) 14.  Mr. Jayson Repine, Student at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (address exempt) There being no other persons wishing to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Responding to comments made by residents opposing the application, Mr. Fernandez stated the applicant was prepared to upgrade and improve the existing public address (PA) system and install a 32 foot high fiber netting around the Lacrosse field to prevent stray balls from entering neighboring properties. Commissioner Diaz asked staff whether there were any outstanding issues which still needed to be addressed. Mr. Kogon reiterated staff recommended approval of the application with conditions and suggested implementing restrictions on the operation of the new outdoor speakers including limiting the hours of operation to address concerns voiced by the neighbors.   He added the applicant submitted a photometric study of the proposed lighting to the County for review which revealed the lighting was well within spillage guidelines. Commissioner Diaz commented on the efforts made by the applicant to be a good neighbor and spoke about the Boardï¿½s commitment to meeting the needs of all schools regardless of affiliation.  He agreed that the issues related to the existing loud speaker needed to be addressed and suggested replacing the old public announcement (PA) system with a newer model which focused on zones and minimized noise spillage into the neighborhood. Chairwoman Edmonson inquired about the age of the football field and equipment. Mr. Stewart explained the football field had been relocated several times over the years since 1987 with the current speaker system installed in 1990. Commissioner Heyman indicated her support for the foregoing application and suggested constructing a cone on the back of the light to further minimize light spillage.  She pointed out the Countyï¿½s existing noise ordinance should be sufficient to limit usage and recommended the applicant purchase directional loudspeakers to minimize noise spillage. Commissioner Sosa noted the application prohibited the use of the sports field on Sundays and voiced her support for the application, commending the applicant on the proposed chapel design and field lighting. Commissioner Suarez concurred with the suggestion made by Commissioner Heyman regarding the use of directional speakers to limit noise spillage and pointed out the chapel would not generate any additional traffic since it would be used by the schoolï¿½s students. Commissioner Bovo pointed out most of the residents opposing the application were concerned about the lights and speaker component of the application and stated more assurances were needed to ensure restrictions were adhered to.  He noted the schoolï¿½s parking lot was small and argued events at night would inevitably impact the neighborhoodï¿½s quality of life.  Commissioner Bovo stated while he would support the district commissionerï¿½s decision, the residentsï¿½ concerns should not be ignored and asked whether there were any other requirements or restrictions which could be implemented to protect the neighbors. Commissioner Martinez advised his colleagues that he was in receipt of a letter alleging the school violated conditions of the resolution (Z-18-09) related to ending events. Responding to Commissioner Martinezï¿½ question as to whether fields at public schools were outfitted with lights, Mr. Kogon noted the County was not responsible for regulating lights at public schools and clarified that lights were permitted once they were compliant with the Countyï¿½s foot candle illuminance code. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted public schools were required to comply with the Countyï¿½s Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) and site planning process. Commissioner Martinez noted the zoning process was quasi-judicial and the Boardï¿½s decision should not be based on the schoolï¿½s merits.  He stated while he would follow the district commissionerï¿½s lead, he was concerned about the parking situation at the school and the allegations in the letter that the school was in violation of Zoning Resolution Z-18-09. Commissioner Higgins indicated her support for the application.  She stated residents appeared to be more concerned about the existing PA system and noise spillage and requested the applicant provide a greater commitment to upgrading and improving the existing system to minimize noise spillage. Discussion ensued between Chairwoman Edmonson and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding conditions governed by the Countyï¿½s noise ordinance such as hours of operation for evening activities and use of PA systems at schools. Chairwoman Edmonson urged the applicant to commit to a cut-off time for use of the PA system. Commissioner Martinez pointed out the Countyï¿½s noise ordinance was effective 24 hours. In an effort to protect the interests of the residents, Commissioner Diaz requested the applicant commit to replacing the existing PA system to reduce noise spillage.  He noted the proposed lighting plan was acceptable and requested clarification regarding the hours of operation. Mr. Fernandez reiterated the applicantï¿½s commitment to being a good neighbor and reassured the Board members that the existing PA system would be replaced with an articulated loud speaker system.  He indicated the applicant was prepared to commit to an 11:00 p.m. cut-off time for all speaker and lighting use on the sports field. Discussion ensued among Commissioners Martinez, Diaz, Sosa and Mr. Fernandez about exceptions made for the schoolï¿½s fair. Commissioner Diaz requested the applicant commit to replacing landscape buffering located along the Lacrosse field along with the installation of the new fencing. Mr. Fernandez confirmed the applicantï¿½s intent to replace the damaged ficus hedges located along the Lacrosse field. Discussion ensued between Commissioners Sosa and Diaz regarding the use of non-invasive trees. Commissioner Diaz reiterated the Boardï¿½s support for the construction of a chapel on site and requested the applicant include additional landscape buffering around the chapel. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Kogon reviewed the motion before the Board. Commissioner Diaz insisted all fencing be completed before the start of the new Lacrosse season in February. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Diaz and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding the conditions related to the installation of the new directional PA system. Commissioner Diaz stated while he was confident the school would adhere to all restrictions included as a special condition for the approval of the foregoing application, he would not hesitate to revisit the item if there were complaints from residents about the school violating the conditions of approval. Commissioner Bovo asked whether there was a County ordinance governing the cut-off time for lights in County parks. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Kogon revisited the motion before the Board. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell explained while there was a County ordinance which required parks to close at sundown, the Director for Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces (PROS) had the authority to allow parks to remain open until 11:00 p.m. if they were well lit. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Martinez and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding the 11:00 p.m. cut-off time and days of operation for the sports field. The Board, by motion duly made, seconded and carried, approved the application per staff's recommendation with the following additional conditions: ~   Illumination and activity for the sports field shall terminate at 11 p.m.; ~   Operation of loud speakers for the sports field shall terminate at 11 p.m.; ~   The applicant shall apply for a fence permit to secure the Lacrosse field within 6 months and complete fencing before the Lacrosse season begins. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-12-19. 19 ADJOURNMENT REPORT: All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s meeting were transferred to the care, custody and control of the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources.

Mr. Javier Fernandez, Attorney, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida noted the  individuals  in attendance today were  in support of the foregoing application, and in an effort to save time they would stand and acknowledge their support of the project.

Moss Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 13 - 0 REPORT: Commissioner Moss presented a motion to defer the foregoing application.  He explained that the Community Council voted one way, but staff was recommending approval.  Commissioner Moss indicated he needed additional time to review this issue. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer-Raurell recommended that Chairwoman Edmonson open the public hearing for the limited purpose of comments on the suggested deferral prior to taking a vote. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing for comments regarding the suggested deferral. Mr. Jeff Berkow, Berkow, Radell Fernandez and Larkin, attorney representing the applicants and the principal Chris Korge, explained the applicant was moving forward with this application because the lenders were threatening to call Mr. Korgeï¿½s loans on this property if he did not move forward with development.  The applicant had no plans to do any development anytime soon; however, this application was the minimum step the lender would accept to move forward. Mr. Berkow pointed out the principal issue before the Community Council was the applicantï¿½s lack of a detailed site plan, and indicated that he would explain why there was no detailed site plan available and asked for the opportunity to make a presentation today. Following Mr. Berkowï¿½s explanation, Commissioner Moss withdrew his motion to defer due to the financial implications pointed out by counsel. Vice Chairwoman Sosa concurred with Commissioner Mossï¿½ comments; however, noted it would be difficult to take any action on this application without a detailed site plan.  She inquired whether additional time could be extended to the applicant legally to avoid enforcement from the lender. Responding to Vice Chairwoman Sosaï¿½s inquiry, Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer-Raurell explained that the Board could defer for additional information. Mr. Berkow pointed out that if the application was approved today development of the property would not proceed directly to building permit, as the applicant would have to go through a detailed and complex Administrative Site Plan Review application, and other relevant county departments would have to review the site plan.  He opined the staff recommendation would require the applicant to provide a detailed traffic study, a plat approval, and to mitigate any issues with the Department of Environmental Regulatory Management (DERM). After hearing other zoning applications, the Board heard additional testimony regarding Appeal item number 1 later in the meeting. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources Department, read the foregoing application into the record, noting this application had 90 protests and no waivers. Mr. Jeff Berkow, Attorney, Berkow, Radell Fernandez and Larkin, 200 S Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida noted the applicant had decided to request deferral of this application indefinitely, with the intent to return to the Board with a site plan. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing and indicated comments should be limited to the pending deferral. Mr. Nelson Grajoles, 35303 SW 180TH Avenue Lot 381 and 382, Florida City, Florida noted at the last meeting the attorney said he attempted to obtain a letter from the bank; however, there was still no letter. Ms. Mary Redmon, 35303 SW 180TH Avenue Lot 313, Florida City, Florida noted she was in favor of the deferral provided the applicant did not add multi-level apartments.  She expressed concern regarding potential traffic congestion on 5th Avenue, and the lack of proposed roads to clear this congestion. Mr. James Reilly, 35303 SW 180th Avenue Lot 320, Florida City, Florida, President of Gateway West indicated an impact study needed to be conducted prior to developing in the area because this application did not coincide with the rest of the community.  He noted he was opposed to deferring the foregoing application. Ms. Sandra Ford, 1230 NW 178TH Terrace Miami, Florida noted she was unclear about the 5th Avenue development and requested more information about the project. Mr. Berkow said he would meet with Ms. Ford to answer her inquiry. Mr. Chris Korge, 230 Palermo Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida noted he was the applicant and expressed appreciation to the Board members for their consideration of the requested deferral.  He explained he was on a 90-day extension with the bank and would do his best to return with a concrete plan as soon as possible. Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Commissioner Moss made a motion to defer the application indefinitely and urged the applicant to meet with the community to address their concerns. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote. CURRENT ITEMS 2 191325 Zoning PH NO.

Approved Zoning Z-16-19 Mover: Dennis C. Moss Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 8 - 0 Absent: Monestime , Souto Excused: Jordan , Higgins , Martinez REPORT: Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read the application into the record, noting 1 protest and 1 waiver existed. Mr. Kogon noted there was a scrivenerï¿½s error; on request number 6 which was a non-use variance of a dedication, indicated the north and south half in the report, however it should read the east and west half. Graham Penn, Attorney, Bercow Radell Fernandez & Larkin 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida explained the intent of the application and gave a Power Point Presentation regarding HTA Miami Dade Land, LLC. He noted that this application would provide a 55,000 square foot medical office building at Jackson South, with the potential for a second phase in the future.  Mr. Penn indicated that he met with the Rockdale and Richmond Heights community, as a result the applicant had created a generous buffer to accommodate their needs and the neighbors were in support of the application. Mr. Penn presented an aerial photograph of the subject property, and provided a brief description of the subject property.  He noted the current zoning designations on the property and stated that the Board had made it clear that they did not desire to have any residential zoning in the subject area.  Mr. Penn noted the following requests in the application: -a District boundary change to BU-2 -deletion of two covenants -unusual uses for Senior Living -Non-use variances of signage and waiving dedications along portions of SW 97tha Avenue Following further description of the subject property, the covenant and the traffic analysis, Mr. Penn pointed out the future land use of 97th Avenue and that 97th Avenue disappeared in the future land use map at 72nd Avenue; he explained that extending 97th Avenue through the Rockdale neighborhood was a not a good idea, however a traffic analysis indicated that Southwest 102nd Avenue was the only appropriate location to place a bridge.  Mr. Penn listed the reasons roads should not be extended through neighborhoods.   Mr. Penn urged the Board to approve the application. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing, seeing no one come forward the public hearing was closed. Commissioner Moss asked zoning staff for clarification regarding the traffic lay out and the possibility of extending or not extending 97th Avenue. Claudia Diaz, Division Director, Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW), Traffic Division explained that the Department did not approve the proposed application because the applicant refused to change the site plan to include the future connectivity of 97th Avenue.  Ms. Diaz further explained that currently there was not a plan to connect 97th Avenue, however upon analysis from the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and the Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) indicates that the connection needed to occur in the future.  She indicated approval of this application would shut down all possibilities of connecting 97th Avenue in the future. Commissioner Moss noted that although RER had taken into consideration that the Traffic Divisionï¿½s recommendation they still did not approve the application. Replying to Commissioner Mossï¿½ inquiry Mr. Kogon said he took all of the information provided by departments into consideration, however elements in the Comprehensive Planï¿½s policy in the transportation element had conflicting concepts regarding extending major roadways through neighborhoods.  Mr. Kogon read the Comprehensive Plan policies into the record, noting that when reviewing he found that adding one connection could potentially send lots of traffic through an established single family community; he explained from a zoning prospective and looking at the tranquility of an existing neighborhood, these policies yield the zoning recommendations that the non-use variances waive those right of ways are appropriate and he was fully aware that this conflicts with Public Worksï¿½ opinion. Commissioner Moss noted that it was important for the future of Jackson, its facilities and establishing this campus was addressing major needs of the community.  He made a motion to approve the foregoing application as amended. Commissioner Heyman seconded the motion for discussion. Vice Chairwoman Sosa expressed her concern regarding road closures. Commissioner Moss clarified currently there was not a road, and no request to close any road; however he felt it was not necessary to open and extend Southwest 97th Avenue. Vice Chairwoman Sosa expressed that she needed to be further educated on this road extension as well as the covenants. Ms. Diaz noted that the application included a request for vacation of the right of way.  She explained that if vacation of the right of way was approved, there will never be a chance of connectivity; if the right of was not vacated and a redesign occurs, the road could be opened.  Ms. Diaz further explained that the community currently had no access to SW 152nd Street; if development continues in this area and the infrastructure was not put in place there would be problems expanding in the future. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired about traffic congestion surrounding the subject area. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s inquiry, Ms. Diaz explained that she and staff had declined reviewing the traffic study because the traffic study was in conjunction with the site plan, due to the issues with the site plan and the closure.  She indicated if the Board moves forward with the application, the applicant would have to return for the analysis of the traffic study.  Ms. Diaz pointed out she was unaware of the traffic conditions and any consequences of this development on the traffic in the area since the site plan was not approved by DTPW. Mr. Kogon explained, if the Board approves the foregoing application, RER had prepared conditions for DTPW consideration. Commissioner Levine Cava noted she was in support of this project as the facilities were needed, she stated she hoped the connectivity to Jackson South would be enhanced. Commissioner Diaz noted he was in support of the foregoing application; however he was not in support of having only one entrance and one exit.  He pointed out his concern regarding hurting the area in the future by creating more traffic and indicated that if an easement for the future of the area was added he would support it. Further discussion ensued between Commissioners Moss and Diaz regarding the project and the possibility of opening more roads surrounding the subject property. Commissioner Monestime indicated that he was absent during most of the discussion regarding this application and would abstain from voting. Commissioner Souto also noted that he would abstain from voting because he had not heard all testimony. The Board proceeded to vote on the foregoing application as presented.

Heyman Vote: 10 - 0 Excused: Jordan , Higgins , Martinez REPORT: Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read the application into the record, noting  no protests or waivers existed. Dany Raffoul 1800 Sunset Harbor Drive, Miami Beach, Florida noted he was speaking on behalf of his Grandfather, Mr. Alexander Gramarnik.  Mr. Raffoul explained that Mr. Gramarnik owned two (2) contiguous parcels of land 651 NW 117th Street and 661 NW 118th Street which are both located in the North Central Urban District.  He noted that he and Mr. Gramarnik requested a hearing to correct what they believed to be a hardship on the tenants due to zoning change and an error.  Mr. Raffoul explained the hardship of the tenants, noting that one tenant operated a car body shop on the subject property for nine (9) years.  This tenant had a certificate of use application from February 2010, during that time the zoning was Business Districts, Special (BU-2), which permitted operating an auto body shop without painting.  Mr. Raffoul went on to state that the second tenant operated Prestige import and export who has been able to receive a certificate of use to do mechanics at the business.  He noted that when the tenant (owner of Prestige Import) attempted to obtain his certificate of use, the county did not inform him that he was unable to do mechanics in the warehouse on the property because the new zoning did not allow it.  Mr. Raffoul said that Mr. Gramarnik was unaware that his property had been rezoned and this created a hardship on the tenants.  Mr. Raffoul said once Mr. Gramarnik inquired, County staff informed him that the tenants use was no longer allowed due to the rezoning, staff also informed him that the property needed to be connected to the water and sewer system.  Subsequently, Mr. Gramarnik incurred a $12,000 cost to bring the property into compliance and connect to the sewer system, as well as an additional $12,000 for this hearing.  Mr. Raffoul said that it was suggested to Mr. Granarnik by county staff to file for a zoning change, unfortunately the same department that recommended him to file for the change, gave an unfavorable recommendation for this change. Mr. Gramarnik explained the situation further and in closing indicated the properties were both warehouses housing small businesses and located on streets with no outlets. He believed the usage and zoning should be changed to continue business as usual. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing, seeing no one come forward in connection with the forgoing application, it was closed. Commissioner Monestime noted the subject area was an eye sore and had junk cars everywhere.  He encouraged Mr. Gramarnik to clean up the properties.  Commissioner Monestime inquired about the certificate of use and whether or not the previous use was permitted. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s inquiry Mr. Kogon explained that the subject property was originally zoned BU-2 which was limited to certain automotive uses and some of the neighbors were zoned BU-3 which allowed for more automotive uses.  The current Mixed-Use Corridor (MC) district zoning restricted all automotive uses except for gas station.  Mr. Kogon noted after reviewing the applicantï¿½s certificate of use in comparison to the adjacent uses, the applicant was correct there were MC use properties were nearby and adjacent to his property.  He also explained that denial was recommended because the Charrette discouraged new automotive uses along this corridor because it was a premium transit corridor.  Mr. Kogon noted the policy which discouraged these uses was outlined within the staff report, the context of the neighborhood it may be appropriate but it conflicts with the Charrette and as a Department the policy was stronger than the compatibility to the neighborhood. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime, Mr. Kogon and Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel regarding rezoning and whether or not conditions could be placed on a rezoning. Commissioner Monestime indicated that he was prepared to uphold the staffï¿½s recommendation to decline, however this business had been operating in the same place for a long period of time and they should be given the opportunity to continue to operate.  He noted that there needed to be a condition placed to make sure the applicant cleans up the property. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted conditions could not be placed within the confines of this application; however we can refer the proper enforcement to make the applicant come into compliance. Commissioner Monestime noted that if they continue to use the property they need to have the cars inside a fence. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted that this will be referred for enforcement to do an inspection and brought back before the Board if they do not come into compliance. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the motion would be to approve the application as stated to amend the regulating plan to re-designate the property from Mixed Use Corridor to Mixed-Use Corridor Special. Mr. Gramarnik noted that he would clean up the property. Commissioner Heyman expressed her concern regarding the applicantï¿½s failure to maintain the property.  She pointed out the Countyï¿½s policy that if an applicant was in violation the Board would not move forward with the person in violation.  She noted the Board would not move forward until the applicant comes into compliance. Chairwoman Edmonson suggested deferral until the applicant comes into compliance. Commissioner Monestime concurred with the suggested deferral. Commissioner Heyman noted that if this application being deferred, she suggested the applicant have the tenant to bring the repairs inside and consider putting everything inside since the property if it was on a dead end.  She also noted she was in support of the deferral. Commissioner Monestime noted the Board wanted progress in compliance, and will defer this request until the July 25th meeting to allow the tenant to come into compliance. Hearing no further questions or comments the Board proceeded to vote on the deferral. 4 191595 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: \tZ2019000024  --  DISTRICT(S) 4  --  APPLICANT: \tROJO BROS, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S):-\tTHE APPLICANT IS REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT OF THE OJUS URBAN AREA DISTRICT (OUAD) REGULATING PLANS TO RE-DESIGNATE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM RESIDENTIAL MODIFIED (RM) TO MIXED-USE MAIN STREET (MM).  --  LOCATION\t 2580 NE 90 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

Carlos Migoya, President/CEO, Jackson Health System gave a Power Point Presentation regarding the Jackson South Medical Center (JSMC) expansion; he gave a brief background of how the project had progressed over the years and noted the name of the trauma center will be changed to Ryder Trauma at Jackson South.  Mr. Migoya noted that parking at the facility was extremely challenging and proposed a 650 car parking garage.  He pointed out that because the current building was too small for the amount of doctors a 60,000 square foot medical building would be constructed as well. He indicated a crosswalk bridge would be constructed to connect the main Jackson South Hospital facility to the medical building.  Mr. Migoya stated he had an aggressive capital plan to make this project work.  In addition, he proposed a 100 bed tower on the west side of the facility, which would make the hospital a 330 bed hospital. He pointed out Jackson had an informal agreement with the neighbors which he intended to honor and all of the neighbors were in support but unhappy with the increase of traffic due to the project. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing, seeing no one come forward the public hearing was closed. Commissioner Levine Cava expressed appreciation to Mr. Migoya for his work developing this project. She expressed concern regarding the parking garage being five stories and the possibility of placing a buffer inside the garage to prohibit people inside the garage from looking onto the neighborï¿½s properties. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s concerns, Mr. Migoya explained that he did discuss buffering the garage and pointed out that the neighbors agreed foliage would be a more aesthetically pleasing buffer. Commissioner Levine Cava stated the pedestrian bridge was an important element to connect the office building and inquired whether funds were currently available for construction of the bridge. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s inquiry Mr. Migoya noted that portion of the financing has not been finalized, and clarified that since it was a pedestrian bridge the cost would not be extremely high. Commissioner Levine Cava suggested amending the application to place screening on the north face of the parking garage as a buffer to the neighbors. Commissioner Moss gave a brief history regarding his promise to the community to bring a public hospital to the South Dade area.  He pointed out that Kendall hospital was a county hospital but had closed with a promise to the community that it would be replaced in the future.  Commissioner Moss said bonds had been issued and eventually the Public Health Trust was able to acquire Jackson South and make good on the promise made to the community.  He inquired about the potential of expanding the medical center and hospital in the future based on the need to do so; and noted he wanted to ensure the medical campus would accommodate any additional needs in the future. Mr. Migoya noted that the campus had been maximized as much as possible and this campus would be fit to accommodate all needs for the next 10 years.  The proposal was for 60,000 square feet, which was more than what was currently needed but he was certain the JMSC would grow and all of the space eventually would be used at the center. Vice Chairwoman Sosa expressed her concern with Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s suggestion to cover the garage with a screen to buffer the view onto the properties below it and noted the screen would look like a wall and would not be aesthetically pleasing. Responding to Vice Chairwoman Sosaï¿½s comments, Mr. Migoya stated this was a five (5) story parking garage and aesthetics were important but the need to diffuse exhaust and keep air flowing was important as well. Vice Chairwoman Sosa requested Mr. Migoya to look at which option was better for the garage. Mr. Migoya indicated he would work with Vice Chairwoman Sosa and Commissioner Levine Cava to ensure the buffer was effective, aesthetically pleasing and comfortable for the neighbors as well. Commissioner Levine Cava amended the application to further explore screening the north face of the garage. Hearing no further comments or questions the Board proceeded to vote on the foregoing application as amended.

Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing and upon seeing no one appear to speak, closed the public hearing. Mr. Daniel Raffoul, 1800 Sunset Harbor Drive, Apartment 2207, Miami Beach FL, appeared on behalf of his grandfather, the applicant, Mr. Alexander Gamarnik and stated in response to comments made by Commissioner Monestime at the June 20, 2019 Zoning meeting, the applicant had made every effort to clean the area and even installed ï¿½no parkingï¿½ signage and fire lanes throughout the site.  Mr. Raffoul noted the applicant hired staff to continue maintaining the area including the litter left by patrons of the food trucks located along 117th Street and submitted photos of the now clean area into the record as exhibits. Commissioner Monestime acknowledged improvements made to the subject properties as evidenced in the photos submitted by Mr. Raffoul and asked whether approval of the application could be contiguous to the maintenance and upkeep of the lots. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer-Raurell pointed out the application sought to amend the North Central Urban Area District (NCUAD) regulating plan to re-designate the subject property from mixed use corridor (MC) to mixed use corridor special (MCS) and suggested directing staff to monitor the property and enforce pursuant to the Countyï¿½s code. Commissioner Monestime requested clarification regarding the proper vehicle to approve the application in light of staffï¿½s recommendation to deny without prejudice.

Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board: 1.   Mr. Duane Smith, 12904 SW 28th Terrace, Homestead FL, stated his opposition to the foregoing application. 2.  Ms. Carolyn Edgecomb, 13795 SW 268th Street, Homestead FL, appeared on behalf of the Naranja/Leisure City Community Advisory Committee (also in attendance and waved in support) in support of the foregoing item. The following persons appeared and waved in support of the item: ~   Mr. James Busher, 10780 SW 220 Street, Goulds FL ~   Ms. Willie Dowdell, 1518 E. Mowry Drive, Miami FL ~   Ms. Robin Edgecomb, 13751 SW 268th Street, Miami FL ~   Ms. Bertha Gomez, 21164 SW 112th Avenue, Miami FL ~   Mr. Brooks Brown, 11927 SW 218th Street, Miami FL ~   Ms. Janice Saunders, 26520 SW 136th Avenue, Miami FL Seeing no other persons appear to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Mr. Alejandro Arias, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, the George C. Busher Living Trust, to request approval of the applicantï¿½s appeal related to the rezoning of the subject property from agricultural District (AU), to minimum apartment house district (RU-3M) along with minor non-use variances.  He noted in May 2014, the Board approved the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) re-designation of the subject site from low density residential to low medium density residential and explained todayï¿½s (7/25) request was the second step in the process which would rezone the property and allow for redevelopment in line with the Countyï¿½s 2014 vision. Mr. Arias provided a brief history of the subject property and reviewed the surrounding areas.  With the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, he proceeded to summarize the site plans for the proposed 89 unit townhome development, noting access points at Southwest 286th Street and Southwest 132nd Avenue. Mr. Arias reported the development would act as a natural transition point between the residential zoned properties located in the north, east and west of the subject property and the industrial zoned properties situated to the south.  He stated while the current low medium density designation allowed for a maximum of 126 dwelling units on the site, and the requested RU-3M zoning designation would permit up to 125 units, the applicant sought to develop 89 units, well below the permitted maximum number. Mr. Arias informed the Board members that the applicant had also proffered a declaration of restrictions which would tie the development of the property to the submitted site plan and a maximum density of 89 townhome units.  He noted the proposed development would meet all set back requirements and include buffer landscaping as well as a decorative wall around the perimeter of the subject property, which would serve to mitigate any visual impact the two story townhomes may have on the abutting properties.  Mr. Arias indicated the proposed plans included interconnecting sidewalks and landscape strips to promote pedestrian use and noted auto traffic would be freely disbursed through a system of looping right of ways from the guest parking and residential units to adjacent street networks for seamless connectivity. Mr. Arias pointed out the applicant planned to provide 20 percent more parking (35 more parking spaces) than required by Code and reiterated staffï¿½s findings that the proposed development would have no significant impact on the surrounding roadways and transportation facilities while meeting the traffic concurrency requirements.  He pointed out all service departments including Department of Environmental Resources Management (DERM), fire rescue, police and water and sewer have determined the project would not result in a reduction in the Level of Services (LOS) and spoke about the projectï¿½s contribution to the Countyï¿½s economic prosperity and viability through the creation of jobs and much needed housing supply. Mr. Arias requested the Board approve the applicantï¿½s request to appeal the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s (CZAB #15) denial of the application pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendations. Commissioner Moss inquired what criteria was used by staff to arrive at their recommendation and asked whether the parking issues were addressed. Ms. Newsome pointed out the plans for the proposed development exceeded the Countyï¿½s parking requirements and was consistent with the CDMP land use plan map.  She noted the non-use variance requests were contained to the site and would not result in spillage to the surrounding areas. Ms. Newsome revisited the transitional benefits of the proposed development and upheld staffï¿½s recommendations. Revisiting Mr. Smithï¿½s concerns about increased traffic congestion in the area, Commissioner Moss asked staff to review the proximity of the subject property to the turnpike and other major roadways. Ms. Newsome provided an overview of the roadways reviewed by staff during the concurrency evaluation and advised the Board members that there were no changes to the level of service on any of the surrounding roadways. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Moss and Ms. Newsome as to whether the community as a whole objected to the proposed development. Commissioner Heyman noted she arrived late to todayï¿½s (7/25) meeting and did not hear the entire discussion. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell recommended Commissioner Heyman refrain from voting. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve staffï¿½s recommendation. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-21-19. Later in the meeting Commissioner Jordan commended Ms. Edgecomb and the members of the Naranja Community Advisory Committee present at todayï¿½s (7/25) Zoning meeting for attending and advocating for the community they represent and serve.

Approved staff recommendation for denial Zoning Z-24-19 Mover: Sally A. Heyman Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 7 - 2 No: Suarez , Cava Excused: Jordan , Monestime , Diaz , Bovo, Jr. REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director of Development Services, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting it was an appeal with 138 protests and 114 waivers. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing for members of the public wishing to speak on the foregoing application, and the following persons appeared before the Board in support: 1. \tMr. Rene Taylor, 29301 SW 173 Court, Miami, Florida 2. \tMs. Elizabeth Roque, 7735 NW 146 Street #306, Miami Lakes, Florida The following persons appeared before the Board in opposition: 1. \tMr. Sidney Robinson, 23515 SW 162 Avenue, Redland, Florida Hearing no other members of the public wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Ms. Rachel Streitfeld, Bright Side Legal, 1455 North Treasure Drive, North Bay Village, Florida, appeared before the Board on behalf of Mr. Thomas Blakely, the appellant. She stated that she did not intend to challenge the applicationï¿½s consistency with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP), and she explained the history of the application and the reasons for appealing the application. She asked that the Board reverse approval of the application and deny the application. Mr. Jeffrey Bercow, Bercow Radell Fernandez & Larkin, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 850, Miami, Florida, advised he represented the owner/applicant; and he explained the property location and designations. He pointed out County staff was recommending denial of the appeal and approval of  the rezoning request, and he explained the rationale for County staffï¿½s recommendation. He clarified the applicant was requesting a rezoning from Agricultural District (AU) and Interim District (GU) to Estates Modified District (EU-M) to be able to build twenty (20) homes on the site. He noted there were no objections filed from any governmental agencies. He made a PowerPoint presentation explaining the rationale that supported the rezoning request, and he submitted for the record documents supporting the rezoning request. He stated the application was consistent with EU-M zoning in the area, met CDMP requirements, and satisfied all criteria for zoning. Ms. Streitfeld reiterated she did not intend to challenge the applicationï¿½s consistency with the CDMP, but the applicant had several opportunities to make these arguments before the Community Council. She noted the application had been denied by the Community Council in May 2018, and the application had also been deferred three (3) times before that decision was made. She pointed out there had been much vote switching in the applicationï¿½s decision. Discussion ensued among the members of the Board and Mr. Bercow regarding what were the options available to the Board. Commissioner Levine Cava advised it was a very difficult case since the application had undergone a two (2) year process. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to the statement made by Ms. Streitfeld that there was no competent basis to change the opinion at the Community Council hearing, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the statement did not accurately reflect the process undergone by this application. He explained the process, errors made in the process, and how the recommendation was arrived at. He noted this was the first time this application was legally before the Board in proper form. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava, Mr. Bercow, and Ms. Streitfeld regarding the efforts made to communicate with the residents, the compromises offered to the residents, and what had happened during the applicationï¿½s process. Pursuant to Vice Chairwoman Sosaï¿½s questions relating to the applicationï¿½s compatibility to the CDMP and zoning district requested, Mr. Kogon explained the foregoing application was compatible with the CDPM and inside the UDB line; but there was currently no covenant in place. He noted the EU-M zoning required 15,000 square foot lots; and when roadway  dedications were included in the calculations, the applicant would only be theoretically able to build approximately 22-24 units. He noted the applicant would have to proffer a covenant if they wished to have a self-imposed limitation of twenty (20) units. Vice Chairwoman Sosa commented the only positive thing about this application was that it met the Countyï¿½s increased population demand due to its location inside the UDB line. Pursuant to the County Attorneyï¿½s  Office recommendation, Chairwoman Edmonson announced a training meeting was scheduled for 12:30 p.m. for training on the Head Start Program. This training was mandated by the Federal Government to ensure the Boardï¿½s full understanding and compliance with the $75 million Head Start Program grants and the Boardï¿½s role in this tri-government structure. All members of the Board were requested to attend this meeting after the Zoning Hearing concluded. Commissioner Martinez joined the meeting and noted he had listened to the presentation and the arguments presented from his office. He asked if there were any objections to him voting on the foregoing application. No one objected to Commissioner Martinez staying for the remainder of the presentation and voting on it. Commissioner Heyman noted todayï¿½s (10/31) decision was based on law and the Boardï¿½s interpretation of the law. She pointed out everything being asked was allowable and consistent with the area; therefore, she would support the application. In response to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ question regarding whether the applicant would be able to increase the number of units without a covenant in place, Mr. Kogon explained the CDMP would allow the applicant to build twenty five (25) units; but the applicant would only be able to physically build twenty (20) units maximum due to the EU-M zoning and the roadway dedications already in place. Chairwoman Edmonson commented that she was unsupportive of building outside of the UDB line, but most commission districts were already build out. She noted the County needed additional housing. She expressed her support for the application based on the facts that she found no reasons for denial, the County needed additional housing, and the application was compatible with the area. She also noted there were no objections from any governmental agencies, and County staff had recommended approval. Therefore, she was voting to deny the appeal as recommended by staff. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s questions, Mr. Kogon explained the meaning of  Severable Use Rights (SURs). He noted those were transfers of density from the East Everglades Area, which was a program created in the 1980s. He advised the benefits of the Workforce Housing Ordinance would also be available to the applicant, and these two programs had the potential to yield the applicant additional units unless a covenant was in place to prohibit the use of  those programs to build additional units. Commissioner Levine Cava advised she understood this application had support and the reasons for it. She noted there were opportunities along the corridor and not so close to agricultural land, noting she felt uncomfortable supporting the application without having a compromise in place. Therefore, she would move to affirm the appeal. Chairwoman Edmonson seconded Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s motion, but there was lack of support from the members of the Board. It was moved by Commissioner Heyman that the Board of County Commissioners deny the appeal. This motion was seconded by Vice Chairwoman Sosa. Hearing no other comments or objections, the members of the Board proceeded to take a roll call vote on the motion to deny the appeal. The members of the Board approved staff's recommendation to deny appeal and to sustain the Community Zoning Advisory Board (CZAB) decision. 7/25/2019 Deferred by the Zoning Board DEFERRED REMANDED FROM CIRCUIT COURT APPEAL ITEM B 192315 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: Z2018000069  --  DISTRICT(S) 9  --  APPLICANT: ACADEMIR CHARTER SCHOOLS, INC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S):-THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO PERMIT A CHARTER SCHOOL ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FOR 584 STUDENTS IN GRADES K-8.

Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to members of the public wishing to speak on the foregoing application, and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition: 1. \tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229 Street, Miami, Florida 2. \tMs. Margie Pikarsky, 19000 SW 264 Street, Miami, Florida 3. \tMs. Sarai Cruz, 21941 SW 124 Court, Miami, Florida Chairwoman Edmonson exited the meeting, and Vice Chairwoman Sosa chaired the meeting. Mr. Juan Mayol appeared before the Board to represent the applicant and made a PowerPoint presentation to explain the merits of the foregoing application, the chronological events, and the zoning changes. He noted there had been no oppositions until today (10/31). He stated there were the following changes to the application: 1. \tthat the school had agreed to provide attendance preference, as permitted by State law, to students residing within two (2) miles of the property to ensure the school remained a community school; 2. \tthat as part of the mediated agreement, the school had also agreed to provide complimentary transportation to anyone in need of transportation to alleviate traffic; and 3. \tthat the applicant had agreed to additional traffic analysis to test and validate the assumption of the traffic study and make adjustments, if necessary, to accommodate staffï¿½s comment after two (2) years of operationss. Mr. Mayol urged the Board to approve the applicantion in accordance with County staffï¿½s recommendation and asked for acceptance of the proffered Declaration of Restrictions. Pursuant Commissioner Mossï¿½ questions regarding whether the applicant was requesting a special exception to allow for a charter school, Mr. Kogon responded affirmatively. He noted it was pursuant to the requirements of the Miami-Dade Code (the Code), which required the Boardï¿½s approval for all charter schools. He explained the Code was consistent in many zoning districts, but the impact of each charter school was unique to each school and neighborhood. Consequently, a public hearing before the Board was required. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Moss and Mr. Kogon relating to the Codeï¿½s requirements in connection with parking lots and driveways and the schoolï¿½s parking plan. In connection with Commissioner Mossï¿½ question relating to the declared surplus of students seats, Mr. Kogon advised the number was correct. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Moss and Mr. Kogon relating to the Summary of Impacts from the foregoing application, policies that would be implemented for the overall welfare of the neighborhood, and the zoning analysis. Commissioner Moss commented that the proposed school was located close to the neighborhood of Goulds, and charter schools always threatened traditional public schools in challenged neighborhoods because they pulled students from those schools causing the schools to be either closed or repurposed. Therefore, he would motion to deny approval of the foregoing application since it was approved for housing or some other type of residential use last time it was before the Board. Commissioner Martinez commented he would follow Commissioner Mossï¿½ lead since he had always respected the decision of other commissioners within their district, but public schools were losing their student population due to the quality of education. He also noted it was not the Boardï¿½s responsibility to make neither the parentï¿½s school choice nor the Boardï¿½s concern. Commissioner Heyman commented the debate of charter schools versus public schools was not being addressed properly at the State level, and the public school budget should not be reduced when students elect to attend a charter school because it was already under budgeted. Commissioner Heyman commented that she would like not to have this issue considered until SW 216th Street was repaired because of the commuting problems of the neighbors within that area or those trying to get through the area. Mr. Mayol advised the issue related to SW 216th Street had already been addressed. Vice Chairwoman Sosa advised she would respect Commissioner Mossï¿½ decision for his district since he had always been very respectful of her district, but she believed everyone and parents should have the ability to choose the school. She commented on the achievements of public schools, and the parentï¿½s lack of knowledge regarding the use of non-certified teachers by charter schools. Commissioner Souto commented that he believed commissionersï¿½ decisions over their districts should be respected. Hearing no other comments or objections, the members of the  Board proceeded to take a roll call vote to deny the motion. The members of the Board approved staff's recommendation to deny appeal and sustain Community Zoning Advisory Board (CZAB) decision and to accept proferred covenant.

Mr. Gregory Fontela, Bercow Radell Fernandez & Larkin, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 850, Miami, Florida, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, 22 Princeton, LLC, and made a PowerPoint presentation to request three (3) changes to the regulating plan maps of the Princeton Community Urban Center Districts in order to accommodate and allow for redevelopment of the site to spark and intensify mix use development in the vicinity of the South Dixie Highway in line with the goals of the County, as expressed in the CDMP, and the intent of the Princeton Community Urban Center District. He explained the merits and intent of the application. He advised the applicant was requesting the following changes: 1. \tModification to the land use regulating plan; 2. \tModification to the sub-district of the regulating plan; and 3. \tModification to the street types regulating plan. Mr. Jeffrey Bercow advised that SW 137th Avenue was an important boulevard within this urban center but an important connector from Kendall Drive to South Dade; and if the Board wished to make transit functional and attract federal funding, density needed to be increased. Chairwoman Edmonson rejoined the meeting and commented, for the record, that she had continued to listen to the testimony provided after she left the meeting. Commissioner Levine Cava advised the County had two (2) policies implemented that made this County the correct place for development. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s questions relating to the coordination of bus stations as close to developments as possible, Mr. Fontela advised there was a bus stop in front of the site and read into the record a portion of the CDMP language that supported bus stop developments. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to whether there was an opportunity for greater connectivity, Mr. Bercow advised he had discussed in a previous meeting the construction of a proposed bus station; and the applicant would still like to develop the proposed bus stop. Pursuant to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question relating to the density of the development, Mr. Fontela advised this was a proposal for the planning for the site to reflect what they believed would be the adequate conditions for the Princeton Community Urban Center. Commissioner Levine Cava advised she would support approval of the foregoing application with the hope that the market would reduce the density. Vice Chairwoman Sosa commented on the issue of developing 12-story buildings and the negative impact of tall buildings on neighborhoods. Pursuant to Vice Chairwoman Sosaï¿½s question relating to street closures, Mr. Kogon advised that, as part of this application, there were proposed road closures as part of that zoning; and he explained a minor road running through the project would be closed. He advised all surrounding roadways would remain functioning in their full capacity. Discussion ensued between Vice Chairwoman Sosa and Mr. Kogon regarding the administrative process for parking facilities. Commissioner Moss advised the developer should look at developing a unique project and that was his hope. He expressed his support for the foregoing application. Commissioner Higgins expressed her support for the foregoing application and asked that attention be given to cars like Uber and Lyft randomly stopping. Hearing no other comments or objections, the members of the Board proceeded to take a roll call vote on the motion to approve.

Mr. Javier Fernandez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared before the Board on behalf of the applicant, South Dixie 29, LLC; and he explained the application. He explained the density would be significantly curtailed, and the applicant had proffered a covenant. He explained the merits of the application. Commissioner Levine Cava commented that this project raised more concern for her than the previous project considered due to the density and the number of private single-story homes surrounding this project. She stated this project was invasive and incompatible; therefore, she felt uncomfortable with it. She stated she would like to see more buffering surrounding the project. She also stated this project was not located within close proximity of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) station; therefore, it was not a true transit-oriented development. Commissioner Levine Cava stated that she preferred to defer this application until proper reconciliation with the department as to the location of the BRT and taking into consideration her other points. Following Chairwoman Edmonsonï¿½s questions regarding whether the members of the Board wished for the signed petition to be submitted to the Clerk by the communityï¿½s residents, the response was that they wished to continue their consideration of the application. Pursuant to Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbelï¿½s question, Commissioner Levine Cava advised she wished to establish a date certain for the foregoing application and hoped the applicant would come back with modifications to the proposed plan. She noted the major impact on the west side needed to be revisited including holding a meeting with the neighbors to review the modifications. Upon conclusion of the foregoing discussion, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced the date certain for this application would be the regularly scheduled Zoning Hearing of this Board in January 23, 2020. Hearing no other comments or objections, the members of the Board proceeded to take a roll call vote on the motion to defer the foregoing application. The members of the Board deferred the foregoing application to the next regularly scheduled Zoning meeting of January 23, 2020, to allow an opportunity to the applicant to modify the application. 2 192591 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: Z2019000118  --  DISTRICT(S) 8  --  APPLICANT: AAPUSHANA INVESTMENT, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO REZONE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM BU-3 LIBERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AND IU-1, LIGHT INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING DISTRICT, TO PERRINE COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (PECUCD).  --  LOCATION: LYING SOUTH OF HIBISCUSS STREET, NORTH OF INDIGO STREET, BETWEEN THE SOUTH DADE TRANSITWAY AND SOUTH DIXIE HIGHWAY, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

ADDITIONALLY, THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING APPROVAL FOR ACCEPTANCE AND EXECUTION OF A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.  --  LOCATION: LYING ON THE WEST SIDE OF I-75 EXPRESSWAY AND EAST SIDE OF NW 97 AVENUE, BETWEEN NW 170 STREET AND THEORETICAL NW 177 TERRACE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved Zoning Z-28-19 Mover: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 7 - 0 Absent: Monestime Excused: Heyman , Higgins , Moss , Souto , Martinez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Department of Regulatory an Economic Resources, read the item into the record. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to public comments and the following persons appeared to speak: Ms. Esther Cintron, 14770 Lewis Road, Miami Lakes, appeared in opposition to the item and commented a new network of services was needed in the area prior to approving any zoning changes. Mr. Eduardo Levin, 8822 W. 34th Court, Hialeah, area resident, appeared in support of this development. Mr. Eduardo Santiesteban, 3466 W 90 Street, Hialeah, appeared in support of the item and opined the community would benefit from this development by adding to their quality of life. Mr. Jose Gonzalez, 700 NW 1 Avenue, Miami, representing Florida East Coast Railroads, appeared in  support of the item and commented more connectivity was better for the area. Mr. Raul Gastesi, 8105 NW 155 Street, representing  the Town of Miami Lakes (the Town), informed the Board there was a resolution from the Town which stated they were allowed to take all action necessary as far as the bridge was concerned and opined this project would affect the bridges. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised it was appropriate at this juncture to allow the Town to be heard on this issue; and any issues pertaining to the bridge would be addressed once the hearing was closed. Mr. Gastesi proceeded with his presentation and noted the applicantï¿½s selling point indicated they would make fewer trips available, to which he emphatically disagreed.  He explained the proposed project was not an appropriate gauge as to a reduction in trips and made reference to the graph exhibit presented to the Board.   Mr. Gastesi proclaimed this project was not suitable for South Florida and indicated it was inaccurate to compare the new project to the old project. He declared there was current gridlock in the area and it could not support additional traffic. Mr. Gastesi announced the Town expressed concern with this project flowing into the Town of Miami Lakes, thereby impacting the services, parks, and public safety; and added this development would require the opening of the bridge to alleviate the additional traffic impacts.  He also pointed out the bridges in the traffic study were an assumption that they would be opened and requested the Board delay this project until the bridge litigation was finalized. Mr. Felix Lasarte, 3250 NE 1 Avenue, Miami, appeared on behalf of the applicant and advised they were proposing a master planned community in the unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County (MDC). He reported ï¿½TERAï¿½, the developer of this project, was in the forefront of development in South Florida and they ensured delivery of value and affordability to the residents of that community. Mr. Lasarte reviewed their graph site plan and noted a third of the property was being preserved as a green area consisting of wetland mitigation areas, trails, and a community center for each pod.  He stated the developer was creating a project that had minimal impact to the area. Mr. Lasarte announced the development agreement guaranteed the infrastructure was in place and the developer was committed to providing certain requests of the neighbors such as: ï¿½\tTemporary fire station ï¿½\tAccess for fire trucks from the unincorporated area ï¿½\tMitigating school impacts by creating an entire classroom (current deficit of 11 students) ï¿½\tDonating money to Miami-Dade County Public School to create an elementary classroom in the existing school in the area to accommodate any impacts Mr. Lasarte displayed an image for the proposed development and opined it differed from the current development in the neighborhood.  He highlighted the support received from the neighbors and explained their request for a change in residential was due to the recent approvals that changed the character of the area and to prevent conflicts between trucks on an industrial site and cars in the vicinity.  Mr. Lasarte announced they were proposing 1,369 units which generated 767 peak PM hour trips versus 3000 trips; which was more than a reduction of half the trips that were allowed under the current zoning approval. Mr. Larsarte informed the Board MDC staff worked with the community to ensure there was enough right- of-way to accommodate all of the projects and specified it was the developerï¿½s goal to work with the county to build projects that would benefit the neighborhood and future residents. Mr. Joe Goldstein, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared on behalf of the applicant and testified the development agreement was a new mechanism instituted by the County to replace the Developmental Regional Impact (DRI) process for larger developments and allowed for long term planning.  He reported this development agreement addressed traffic, transit, parks, fire and other related issues.   Mr. Goldstein mentioned they were working through final language relating to technical provisions, but implied these agreements benefited the long term planning and established the transportation grid and plans for the future of MDC. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding plans to mitigate the increase in traffic and the extension of transit service, Mr. Lasarte advised the applicant has committed to buy two (2) buses from MDC at a cost of $1.8 million to service this grid area. Mr. Kogon stated at this stage of the development the Transit Department would conduct a review and plan accordingly to expand the routes as deemed necessary. In reference to the question pertaining to the lack of parks in the area, Mr. Kogon also stated as part of the covenant for the land use amendment, the developer was required to work with the Parks Department and proffer a park or they would be required to pay the requisite impact fees for parks in the vicinity.  Mr. Kogon affirmed the development agreement had strict provisions for the timing of a temporary fire facility and declared the project would only move forward once the general services and requirements were met. Commissioner Sosa stated she supported the application and commented this development was good for the area and the industrial component was not desired by the neighbors. Responding to Commissioner Jordanï¿½s question, Mr. Lasarte explained there were two bridges located on NW 154th and NW 170th street that were currently closed; and indicated staff and the County deemed the 170th street bridge should be opened prior to this application.  Mr. Lasarte added this project travels independently of the bridges and the pending litigation between the Town of Miami Lakes and Miami-Dade County.   He also mentioned the County Attorneyï¿½s office has made provisions within the development agreement that in the event the bridges were not open; the developer was required to find concurrency elsewhere. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel declared the development agreement specifically addressed the approval of this application regardless of the outcome of the pending litigation relating to the opening of the bridges. He stated their current traffic study assumed the bridges would be opened in accordance with the county plan, but at the time of platting, if changes have occurred as a result of litigation, the applicant would be required to re-review to show the ability to accommodate traffic. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel also clarified the bridges were the property of the Florida Department of Transportation. Commissioner Bovo expressed concern with the Town of Miami Lakes discussing development on the west side of I-75 and remarked their development would impact those bridges as well.  He stated he supported the application and also mentioned his commitment to support the Mayor of Miami Lakes with the development of a park.  Commissioner Bovo reminded his colleagues they were responsible for the global movement of people and opined the NW 170th street bridge should be opened for connectivity of residents on both the east and west side of I-75. Commissioner Diaz stated the aforementioned bridges in the subject area had been slated to open for many years but, due to various reasons, that action had not taken place.  He mentioned a town hall meeting was held and the residents stressed the need for more general life saving services and connectivity within the area and moved for the approval of the application. Aca Kerbel clarified for the record, ï¿½on handwritten page 25 of the development agreement, on conditions of development and pad agreement, the owner and developer jointly and separately agree to develop the project substantially in accordance with the following criteria.ï¿½ Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-28-19. 19 ADJOURNMENT REPORT: There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting adjourned at 10:43 a.m. 3 CONSENT AGENDA 9/25/2024 Agenda Key: 4358 Home | Agendas | Minutes | Legislative Search | Lobbyist Registration | Legislative Reports 2024 BCC Meeting Calendar | Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances | ADA Notice | Home | Using Our Site | About | Phone\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDirectory | Privacy | Disclaimer E-mail your comments,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tquestions and suggestions to Webmaster Web Site\r\n\t\t\t\t\tï¿½ 2024 Miami-Dade County.

Commissioner Monestime asked whether he could meet with staff to discuss the application during the deferral period.

Suarez Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Jordan , Monestime , Diaz , Bovo, Jr. REPORT: Discussion ensued between Chairwoman Edmonson and Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel as to whether the public hearing needed to be reopened for todayï¿½s (1/23) meeting. Chairwoman Edmonson announced the public hearing was opened and closed at the October 31, 2019 Zoning meeting. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated the Board was not required to reopen the public hearing. Commissioners Diaz and Monestime announced they were not present at the October 31, 2019 Zoning meeting and were unable to listen to the proceedings and subsequently exited the room. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 43 protests and no waivers filed. Commissioner Levine Cava noted she requested the applicant meet with the neighbors at the last Zoning meeting (10/31) and asked about the outcome of the meeting. Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Suite 1900, Miami FL, confirmed the applicant met with neighbors on January 14, 2020 pursuant to the Boardï¿½s directions and stated the following topics were discussed at the meeting: ~   The history of the Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan ~   Recently adopted legislation (Ordinance No. 18-124) geared towards increasing intensity and density along planned transit corridors urban centers ~   Introduction of mixed use corridor districts ~   Conditions of the original proffered covenant which limited the height of the proposed development to eight floors along the bus way and 6 floors to the rear of the property which transitioned to single family homes. Mr. Vazquez clarified the existing bus station referenced at the last (10/31) meeting was in fact located on 280th Street directly adjacent to the subject property, and not on 272nd Street as previously stated; and argued there should also be a bus rapid transit (BRT) system at the 280th Street station. Recognizing the residentsï¿½ concerns, Mr. Vazquez noted the applicant had since modified the original covenant to reduce the number of floors from 6 to 4 to the rear of the building and reiterated the importance of maintaining high density along the transit corridor.  He spoke about the importance of the proposed development to increased ridership and how ridership impacted federal funding for future transit projects such as rail. Mr. Vazquez reiterated the proposed developmentï¿½s strengths and requested the Board approve the foregoing application pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendation.  He noted a petition of support had been submitted to the Clerk of the Board for the record. Commissioner Levine Cava requested a neighborhood representative also be allowed to speak regarding the outcome of the meeting with the applicant. Mr. Efren Nunez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of ï¿½The Neighbors of South Dade Parkï¿½ and detailed the residentsï¿½ objections to the proposed development.  Referencing his experience as a City Planner for the City of Los Angeles and Miami, Mr. Nunez argued the proposed development was an intrusion of higher density and intensity into a clearly established single family residential district and submitted a copy of the Massing Study conducted by the neighbors into the record for consideration. Mr. Nunez contended the proposed development failed to provide the height and density transition required for abutting single family residential districts and stated while the applicant did advise the residents of the revised covenant and the proposed height changes, the residents maintain their objection to rezoning the property based on a proffered covenant.  He argued rezoning pursuant to a covenant would be inefficient and set a precedent for future applications and requested the Board use the zoning criteria outlined in the Code and requested the application be denied.  Mr. Nunez filed 117 letters of objection with the Clerk of the Board for the record. Commissioner Levine Cava stated in light of numerous requests to expand the urban center, she requested the administration re-evaluate the area and engage the community to develop a compatible process to include the original charrettes and inquired what had been done to date. Mr. Kogon indicated staff had not yet met with the community. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question as to why the subject property was not included in the urban center to begin with, Mr. Kogon stated he believed the urban center was determined by the boundaries of the original Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) and indicated he would provide additional information at a later time. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired about the existing set-back requirements for buildings fronting the residential development as opposed to the set-back requirements for urban centers. Mr. Kogon stated under the existing zoning designation there was a 25 foot set-back requirement and explained the set-back requirements for urban centers required either a 10 foot or 15 foot ï¿½build toï¿½ line along the roadway located to the west of the subject property and noted on adjoining properties with no roadways there was a 0 foot set-back for the first 2 floors with a mandatory minimum of a 30 foot set-back on structure exceeding 2 floors. Commissioner Levine Cava asked if there was any way to provide better buffering under the current application. Mr. Kogon explained the 10-15 foot ï¿½build toï¿½ set back requirement required between the residential development and proposed project could be increased via a non-use variance request under a different application while the 30 foot set-back required for buildings over two stories could be expanded as a condition of Request No. 7 of the existing application. Commissioner Levine Cava noted she was aware of the bus station located at SW 280th Street and commented on the fact that BRT systems were being planned without considering the location of urban centers.  She expressed her interest in understanding the transit departmentï¿½s plans for the area and whether the BRT station could be relocated to SW 280th Street to service the urban center; and stated while it was the Boardï¿½s policy to consider density along the corridor, she was concerned about the proposed intensity and density given the proximity to the residential development and setting a precedent which would allow greater intensity/density development in the area. Chairwoman Edmonson recognized School Board Member Marta Perezï¿½s presence at todayï¿½s (1/23) meeting. Commissioner Sosa asked what could be developed on the site currently without any modifications. Mr. Kogon stated under the current zoning designation a structure of 2 stories and 35 feet could be built on the subject property. Commissioner Sosa voiced her concerns regarding the absence of a proper buffer and its effects on the residents and inquired what could be done in this case and with future applications, to require a buffer and limit the building height in urban centers located adjacent to residential developments. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained for the purposes of the foregoing application, if the applicant was interested in making the modifications referenced above, the item could be deferred to allow the applicant time to revise the proffered covenant to reflect the changes.  He noted, with regards to future applications, the urban center regulations could be amended by ordinance to add more detail. Commissioner Sosa asked the County Attorneyï¿½s Office to prepare legislation to amend the existing urban center (UC) regulations which would limit building heights and require buffers for Ucs located adjacent to residential developments and commented while she did not want to lose the opportunity to continue working with the applicant, she wanted to provide more protections for the residents.  Commissioner Sosa stated she would support the application if the proposed building height was limited and buffers installed close to the residential development. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified covenants were legal and legally sufficient during zoning proceedings to address the nuances of projects and noted pursuant to State law covenants became a part of the regulation. Commissioner Heyman noted the subject property was 15 acres and asked why the applicant chose to build at that specific point on the property given the location of the closest BRT. Mr. Vazquez argued connectors such as bus stations were just as important as BRTs in providing connectivity and accessibility to pedestrians and reminded the Board members that there was a bus station located at the subject property.  He noted the size of the subject property (15 acres) provided the applicant flexibility to work with the neighbors on the proposed developmentï¿½s height and other proffered conditions. Referencing the Massing Study submitted by Mr. Nunez on behalf of the Neighbors of South Dade Park, Commissioner Heyman contended the term ï¿½urban centerï¿½ was open to interpretation and asked about the expected allowable legal uses. Mr. Kogon briefly reviewed the inaccuracies contained in the Massing Study and explained the theoretical maximum intensity for urban centers at the most concentrated area was 125 units per acre and 15 stories with a gradual decrease in density moving away from the core.  He noted staffï¿½s recommendation took into account the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to transit which allowed for higher density while considering the residents interests and reasoned while the applicantï¿½s proffered covenant was appropriate, it remained subjective. Commissioner Heyman reiterated her concerns regarding the ambiguity regarding the type of development that could be constructed on the subject property given the urban center classification. Mr. Kogon explained the subject property was located along a mixed use corridor which would allow for office, retail and residential. Commissioner Heyman stated she found the pictures included in the Massing Study confusing and asked to hear from the transit department regarding plans for the area. Chairwoman Edmonson asked whether the renderings included in the Massing Study was representative of the applicantï¿½s proposed plans for the site. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the Massing Study was prepared by objectors to the application and not the applicant. Mr. Kogon explained based on the applicationï¿½s proposed density, a parking garage on the subject property was not feasible and noted the ï¿½build toï¿½ requirements would not permit the building to be constructed directly on the roadway as depicted in the Massing Study.  He described the Massing Study as unreasonable and noted in addition to the absence of the 30 foot buffer required for buildings exceeding 2 stories, the Countyï¿½s fenestration (amount of glass added to facades), architectural, landscaping, on street parking and open spaces requirements would not allow such a structure to be built.  Mr. Kogon reassured the Board members there have been other projects built with similar density that have not reached the massing capacity depicted in the study. Commissioner Levine Cava asked about the possibility of relocating the BRT station to an urban center. Mr. Frank Guyamier, Deputy Director Engineering, Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW), identified the two closest BRT stations (SW264th Street to the north and SW 296th Street to the south) and cautioned against relocating any BRT stations since the County had completed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and the BRT station locations were already approved by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Guyamier regarding future plans for the busway and headway times. Mr. Guyamier noted local service was available at SW 280th Street which could then transport users to either BRT stations to the north or south with seven-minute headway. Commissioner Levine Cava acknowledged the applicantï¿½s efforts and thanked them for meeting with the neighbors, but stated she did not believe the applicant had done enough to address the concerns of the community.  She expressed concern regarding the proposed intensity given the proximity to a residential development and moved to deny the application.  Commissioner Levine Cava encouraged the applicant to resubmit a more compatible request and asked staff to establish a process to methodically identify areas for expansion of urban centers so that the Board was not involved. Commissioner Levine Cava indicated she would be amenable to deferring the item with the stipulation that the applicant submit a site plan. Mr. Vazquez contended the Massing Study performed and submitted by the residents was not accurate and agreed to submit a site plan for staffï¿½s review. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel inquired about the deferral date and recommended the deferral motion state ï¿½with leave to amend.ï¿½ Chairwoman Edmonson suggested an indefinite deferral to allow the applicant ample time to amend the application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted an indefinite deferral would require the item be re-advertised at the applicantï¿½s expense. Discussion ensued between Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Vazquez about scheduling a date which would not require re-advertising the item. Mr. Kogon clarified any request for variances needed to be re-advertised. Mr. Vazquez indicated a 90 day deferral would suffice. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced the item would be deferred until the April 23, 2020 Zoning meeting and recommended the applicant incorporate the site plan into the proffered covenant in the event one was developed. Commissioner Levine Cava moved to the defer the foregoing application to the April 23, 2020 Zoning meeting, with leave to amend and direction to the applicant that a site plan be incorporated into the covenant.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Suarez. Hearing no further questions or comments the Board proceeded to vote on the deferral. 10/31/2019 Deferred by the Zoning Board C 200099 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: \tZ2019000113 --  DISTRICT(S) 9 -- APPLICANT: AMERI-HOUSING, CORP. -- SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT OF THE GOULDS COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (GCUCD) LAND USE REGULATING PLAN, TO REDISGNATE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM INDUSTIAL (ID) TO RESIDENTIAL MODIFIED (RM), AND FROM EDGE AND CENTER SUB-DSITRICT, TO CENTER SUB-DISTRICT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.

Martinez Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Jordan , Bovo, Jr. REPORT: Commissioner Moss noted the subject property referenced in the foregoing application was located close to subject site in the previous application and reviewed the intent of the item. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.   Ms. Christina Jordan, 16260 SW 204th Street, Homestead FL. Commissioner Moss noted the speakerï¿½s address in relation to the subject property. 2.  Mr. Dwayne Smith, 12904 SW 285th Terrace, Miami FL, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, indicated his objection to the location of the proposed steel mill plant on the subject property. Commissioner Moss clarified  Mr. Smithï¿½s comments were not related to the foregoing application but were applicable to Agenda Item D which was previously adopted by the Board. Seeing no other persons appear to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Commissioner Levine Cava spoke about the importance of industrial and commercial development in South Dade. Commissioner Monestime voiced his concerns about large scale industrial developments without a housing component and asked if the application contemplated housing. Mr. Kogon explained the foregoing application did not contain a housing component because the subject property was conveyed to the County for economic development purposes which limited the site to industrial and commercial uses only. Commissioner Monestime questioned what could be done to include a housing component close to the subject property. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel stated the County would have to renegotiate the terms of the conveyance with the Federal government to allow residential development on the property. Mr. Kogon advised the Board members there was a residential development to the west of the subject property and spoke about the ï¿½carrying capacityï¿½ for residential development throughout the area.  He noted the property was strategically located to meet the Countyï¿½s land use policies and highlighted the regional and local impact industrial/commercial development on the property would have on the community. Commissioner Sosa voiced her support for the application and recognized the benefits of industrial and commercial development in the creation of new jobs.  She also noted rezoning the subject property would create a buffer between industrial and residential uses in the area. Commissioner Souto indicated his support for the application. Commissioner Diaz commented on the scope, importance and impact of military jobs on the community and briefly remarked on the issue of a dual use base, noting his intent to address the matter at a later time.  He expressed his support for the application and commended Commissioner Moss for his hard work and dedication to improving the area. Commissioner Moss noted he also supported ï¿½dual useï¿½ of the base and stated he would like to see it implemented sooner rather than later. Addressing concerns raised by Commissioner Monestime regarding the absence of a housing component in the application, Commissioner Moss reviewed the different types of housing developments found in the surrounding areas. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application and the foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-3-20.

Moss Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 13 - 0 REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced there was one speaker registered to speak on the foregoing application. Clerk of the Board Director Melissa Adames administered the witnessï¿½ oath to Mr. Jonathan Cruz. Mr. Jonathan Cruz, MDG Designs, 6187 NW 167th Street, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant Greenlands Realtors, Inc. He noted the application was filed in 2018 and sought variances to construct the building to the rear of the property instead of the front, as required by the Naranja Community Urban District (NCUD).  Mr. Cruz pointed out all of the other businesses in the area was located to the back of the properties and argued changing the design to comply with the NCUD requirements would result in various problems to the business owner.  He advised the Board members that there was an alley running across the plot of land and the front area was too small to accommodate the size of the building needed for the business.  Mr. Cruz stated relocating parking to the rear of the property would result in additional parking and traffic congestion and pointed out the recently constructed Walmart was allowed to keep parking to the front of the plot.  He proceeded to publish a PowerPoint presentation detailing the proposed design and site plans for the project.  Mr. Cruz concluded the presentation by pointing out the Florida Power and Lights (FPL) lines located to the front of the subject site and noted relocating the lines would result in additional costs to the applicant. Mr. George F. Mobassaleh, Property owner and President/Owner of Elegant Beauty Supplies, spoke about his business and explained when he purchased the property all the other business buildings, including the recently constructed Walmart, were situated to the rear of the plots with parking located to the front.  He told the Board members that the project would be cost prohibitive and have to be cancelled if the building could not be built to the rear of the lot and asked the Board to approve the application. There being no one registered to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Responding to Commissioner Mossï¿½ request for an explanation regarding staffï¿½s recommendation, Mr. Kogon reviewed the application and noted the applicant had requested eight variances in total.  He explained staffï¿½s recommendation to deny was based on the fact that the applicantï¿½s proposed site plan was a departure from the Countyï¿½s plan for urban mixed use in urban centers.  Mr. Kogon stated while the plan was not inconsistent with existing structures, staff believed the same type of building structure could be achieved by constructing the building to the front of the lot with parking to the rear. Commissioner Moss inquired about the alley issue and how it could be resolved. Mr. Kogon indicated staff did not see any issue with an alley on the site. In response to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question as to how the applicantï¿½s proposed design would contribute to his vision of creating ï¿½Mini Dadelandsï¿½ along US1 and comply with the Countyï¿½s design plans along major transportation modes, Mr. Kogon stated that staff believed the proposed development was an underutilization of the site since the property was zoned to allow for a development up to fifteen stories and an intensity of up to 125 units per acre. Commissioner Moss moved to deny the item without prejudice, per staff's recommendation. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Heyman and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-20-20. 11/21/2019 Deferred by the Zoning Board B 200098 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: \tZ2019000074  --  DISTRICT(S) 6 -- APPLICANT: DOUBLE DK PROPERTIES, LLC -- SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM RU-1, RU-4A, BU-1A, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE SUBJECT PROPERTY WITH A SELF-STORAGE FACILITY.

Approved as amended Zoning Z-9-20 Mover: Jean Monestime Seconder: Barbara J. Jordan Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Higgins , Moss REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced in addition to the applicantï¿½s representative, there was one speaker registered to speak in opposition of the item. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing 1.\t  Mr. Gonzalo De La Cruz ï¿½ no response Mr. Pedro Gassant, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 3300, Miami, FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Double DK Properties, LLC., and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation provided a brief review of the application. He pointed out none of the reviewing agencies had any objections to the application and there was community support for the item as evidenced by the letters of support from the Biscayne Gardens Chambers of Commerce and Biscayne Gardens Civic Association.  Mr. Gassant reviewed the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) Land Use Designation and argued the current Zoning designation was inconsistent with the CDMP Land Use Designation.  He spoke about the dilapidated condition of the property and the surrounding areas and discussed the applicantï¿½s plans to close an unused alley located on the property in addition to the proposed landscaping plan for the site.  Mr. Gassant summarized the traffic study findings and estimated revenues generated for the County through impact fees. There being no one else registered to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public. Commissioner Monestime stated while the application identified the subject property as being located in Commission District  6, the property was actually situated in Commission District 2 and inquired about the advertisement for the application. Mr. Kogon reassured the Board members that notice for the application was based on the property location and stated 1249 notices were mailed out to property owners within a half mile radius of the site. Commissioner Monestime expressed his concerns about the application being advertised for District Commission 6. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel explained the differences between the advertising requirements for CDMP and Zoning applications and reiterated staff confirmed notices were mailed to the neighbors residing within the half mile radius of the subject property. Commissioner Monestime objected to the characterization made by Mr. Gallant during his presentation that the surrounding areas and properties were dilapidated and requested clarification from staff regarding the departmentï¿½s recommendation to approve the rezoning application. Mr. Kogon explained the zoning application process and noted staff always considered the underlying CDMP land use designation when making a recommendation. He spoke about the effect of urbanization on previously residential areas and the subsequent change in the land use plan and reviewed the criteria used by staff to render a favorable recommendation. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Mr. Kogon regarding the need for specific variances to allow the applicant to build a self storage facility on the property, specifically the applicantï¿½s request to waive the zoning regulations requiring a five foot high masonry wall where businesses abuts residential properties. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s questions as to the distance of the subject property from Golden Glades Interchange (GGI) and whether the 7th Avenue Corridor was considered a Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Corridor, Mr. Kogon noted the property was located half a mile from GGI and advised the Board members that while the 7th Avenue corridor was not considered a SMART corridor, the CDMP did include provisions for mixed use corridors other than SMART corridors at various intensities. Commissioner Monestime inquired whether a housing development would be a more appropriate use of the site. Mr. Kogon concurred that there were numerous policies which would encourage a higher density and mixed use of the property. Commissioner Monestime noted while there was no shortage of storage facilities, there was in fact a shortage of housing units and argued the proposed development was an underutilization of the site, similar to the previous application (Item A). Mr. Kogon reviewed the differences in the applications. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Mr. Kogon about the recent increase in density along portions of the 7th Avenue corridor and Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s intent to sponsor legislation to increase the density along the entire 7th Avenue corridor. Commissioner Monestime stated he would support rezoning the property to allow for Office/Business and mixed use but deny the self-storage component of the application and inquired how this could be done. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated a motion to approve the district boundary change and deny the special exception to allow a self-storage facility and the non-use variances listed as requests numbers 3 and 4 would be appropriate.  He deferred to Mr. Kogon to confirm whether a further hearing would be needed to allow for ï¿½fullï¿½ mixed use and whether the non-use variance pertaining to the 5 foot masonry wall would be necessary to allow any business/mixed use on the property. Mr. Kogon reviewed the options available to the applicant. Discussion ensued between Assistant County Attorney Kerbel and Mr. Kogon regarding the masonry wall requirement. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reviewed the proposed language for the motion and confirmed an additional hearing would be needed to allow for full mixed use based on the propertyï¿½s location. Additional discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding increasing densities around the north central urban area district. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel cautioned the Board that expanding the urban center would require a rezoning application which was subject to the Jennings Rule. Commissioner Monestime moved to approve Request No. 1 to change the district boundary from RU-1, Single-Family Residential District, RU-4, Hotel-Apartment House District & BU-1, Neighborhood Business District to BU-1A, Limited Business District and deny Request Nos. 2 through 5.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan. Commissioner Jordan voiced her concerns about the prevalence of storage units in black communities and the negative connotation associated with urban areas.  She expressed an interest with meeting with staff to review the types of facilities recommended for urban communities and argued blighted areas need to be properly developed to encourage growth and development. Commissioner Sosa suggested deferring the item to allow the applicant more time to return with a better proposal which would help the community. Commissioner Martinez asked whether approving the boundary change was beneficial in light of the motion to deny requests 2 through 5. Mr. Gassant requested the item be deferred to allow the applicant to return with a better proposal to meet the needs expressed by the Board. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Mr. Gassant as to the best way to move forward, including waiver of the refiling period if the Board decided to approve the district boundary change and deny the remaining requests (2 through 5). Mr. Gassant reassured the Board members that the applicant would provide new notices to the neighbors to engage the community. Upon the conclusion of extensive discussions on the foregoing application, Commissioner Monestime moved to approve Request No. 1 to change the district boundary from RU-1, Single-Family Residential District, RU-4, Hotel-Apartment House District & BU-1, Neighborhood Business District to BU-1A, Limited Business District; waive the refiling period and deny Request Nos. 2 through 5. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Jordan and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-9-20. 1/23/2020 Deferred by the Zoning Board C 200549 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: Z2019000100  --  DISTRICT(S) 2  --  APPLICANT: VF ACQUISITIONS, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): \tTHE APPLICANT IS SEEKING APPROVAL OF A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM RU-1, SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT TO IU-1, LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.  --  LOCATION: \tLYING APPROXIMATELY 909ï¿½ EAST OF NW 32 AVENUE BETWEEN NW 71 STREET AND NW 73 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-10-20 Mover: Jean Monestime Seconder: Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Heyman , Higgins REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed.  He noted the foregoing application required a majority vote in the event the Board wished to over-turn the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB 8) approval and reviewed the hearing process.

The following speakers appeared telephonically before the Board: 1.\t Mr. Stephen Blimbaum, 3339 NW 67th Street, Miami FL, appeared in support of the application and spoke of the efforts made by himself and other property owners to improve the caliber of tenants renting properties in the area. 2.\tMr. Augusto Fonte, property owner, appeared in opposition of the appeal filed by Mr. Yearby. 3.\tMr. Bobby Hicks, 3111 NW 68th Terrace, Miami FL, noted he owned several parcels in the area and voiced his opposition to the application citing concerns about traffic congestion and noise and air pollution. 4.\tMs. Kimbery Jefferson ï¿½ no response after several attempts Mr. Ronald Yearby, appellant, provided a brief overview of the reasons he appealed the CZABï¿½s approval of the application and argued the procedural process was not followed. Commissioner Jordan advised that she was leaving the meeting for an hour and would return at 2:00 p.m. Mr. Juan Carlos Bermudez, 201 Alhambra Circle, Suite 1205, Coral Gables FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant VF Acquisitions, LLC., and objected to the comments made by Mr. Yearby.  He reviewed staffï¿½s recommendations and accompanying report on the application and noted the applicant worked with the Community Council and residents to address the communityï¿½s concerns. Commissioner Monestime suggested deferring the item to allow him to meet with staff and the applicant to address questions about the application. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel explained while Commissioner Monestime could meet with staff to review the application and transcripts placed into the record, the applicant could not be included in the meeting due to the Jennings Rule. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s request for clarification regarding the subject propertyï¿½s current zoning designation, Mr. Kogon noted the rest of the property was currently zoned Light Industrial Manufacturing District (IU-1). Mr. Kogon clarified the portion of land in question was comprised of 0.76 acres and was currently zoned for single-family residence (RU-1) which the applicant sought to rezone to IU-1 in keeping with the rest of the 5 acre lot. Mr. Bermudez reviewed the intent of the application. Commissioner Higgins noted she was absent for a portion of the discussion and could not vote on the item. Commissioner Diaz voiced his concerns about the allegations made by Mr. Yearby regarding the Homeownerï¿½s Association (HOA) and spoke about the need to look more closely at HOAs in future zoning procedures. Commissioner Monestime moved to deny the appeal and approve the application subject to the Board's acceptance of the proffered covenant, per staff's recommendation. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Diaz and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-10-20.

He noted the applicant was appealing the denial of the Community Council and as such a two-thirds vote of the Board of County Commission (Board) members present in chambers was needed to overturn the denial and approve the applicantï¿½s appeal. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced that there were twenty seven speakers registered to speak on the foregoing application, with fourteen speakers present at this time. Clerk of the Board Director Melissa Adames administered the witness oath to each speaker individually before they addressed the Board members. The following speakers appeared telephonically before the Board: 1.\t    Mr. Ken Forbes, 25101 SW 130th Avenue, Miami FL, spoke about the plan for smart growth        and development in the community and urged the Board to keep moving forward with the plan. 2.\t    Mr. Joseph Vega spoke in support of the application. 3.\t    Mr. Miguel Marte spoke in favor of the application. 4.\t    Ms. Elsa Arellano, 18701 SW 134th Avenue, Miami FL, spoke in opposition of the application      based on the density of the proposed development. 5.\t    Ms. Yvette Bishop, 13193 SW 186th Terrace, Miami FL, spoke in opposition of the application and argued the proposed development was not compatible with the surrounding area. 6.\t    Pablo Gelardy (minor) requested the foregoing application be denied. 7.\t    Mr. Modesto Blanco, 18520 SW 120th Avenue, Miami FL, provided a brief history of the application and expressed his opposition to the application. 8.\t    Ms. Alicia Arellano, 18701 SW 134th Avenue, Miami FL, contended the proposed development was not affordable housing and voiced her opposition to the item. 9.\t    Ms. Irene Fernandez, 18308 SW 134th Terrace, Miami FL, spoke in support of the application. 10.\t    Ms. Odalys Cabrales, 18600 SW 127th Court, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the application. 11.\t    Ms. Jodi Olsen, 15459 SW 147th Street, Miami FL, spoke on behalf of Maylin Gonzalez (phonetic) in support of the application. 12.\t    Mr. J.L. Demps, 11025 SW 223rd Street, Goulds FL, spoke in support of the application. 13.\t    Ms. Enedis Hernandez, 18441 SW 130th Avenue, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the application. There being no other speakers registered to speak on the application, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 3300, Miami, FL appeared on behalf of the applicant, Lennar Homes, LLC., and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation briefly reviewed the application highlighting the project history, application site, companion to the Comprehensive Master Plan (CDMP) amendment, companion zoning application, proffered declaration of restrictions, proposed building designs, reviewing agency recommendations, proximity to major transportation corridors and transit, residential land supply/demand analysis, estimated impact fees, net positive fiscal impact and the 5 top reasons to support application. Mr. Carlos Gonzalez, President of Lennar Homesï¿½ Southeast Florida Division, 730 NW 107th Avenue, Miami FL, spoke about the booming housing market and the need for affordable housing and requested the Board approve the application. Commissioner Levine Cava noted there were several agreements made at the CDMP hearing but not all were incorporated in the proffered covenant.  She stated while the applicant had reduced the number of units to 80 and agreed to road improvements along 134th Avenue and the installation of a bus stop and cross walk, she remained concerned about the applicantï¿½s representation that they would also pay for the turning lane improvements to help alleviate traffic congestion in the area.  Commissioner Levine Cava requested the applicant submit a site plan to help reassure the community about the proposed design and suggested deferring the item until the applicant satisfied all the commitments made at the CDMP hearing. Commissioner Levine Cava moved to defer the foregoing application.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Diaz. Commissioner Sosa recommended items for deferral not be discussed at length in the future. Commissioner Levine Cava reiterated her primary concern was related to improving the connectivity along 134th Avenue. Mr. Mayol clarified the commitment to dedicate the right of way along 134th Avenue did include the construction of the turn lane.  He pointed out the applicant never made any commitments regarding the submittal of a site plan nor were they seeking any variances.  Mr. Mayol reassured the Board members that the applicant would meet with the community once a site plan was developed and voiced his concerns about deferring the item and delaying the project. Commissioner Levine Cava pointed out that the applicant had previously agreed at the CDMP hearing that the entrance to the development would not be located on 134th Avenue and reiterated her concerns that the application did not accurately reflect the agreements and representations made by the applicant at the CDMP hearing. Mr. Mayol confirmed that the applicant would provide and pay for the turning lane at 134th Avenue and reassured the Board members that while there would not be a main entrance located at 134th Avenue, due to a recent change in the County Code, a second point of access/emergency exit may be needed along 134th Avenue. Commissioner Levine Cava requested the applicant include language in the covenant regarding the agreement that the main entrance not be located on 134th Avenue. Commissioner Martinez stated he was not in favor of deferring the application and spoke about the need for a secondary ingress and egress point. Responding to Commissioner Martinezï¿½s question as to what conditions agreed to at the CDMP hearing that were not included in the covenant, Mr. Mayol clarified the applicant deleted unnecessary enhancements of the urban design guidelines which were only applicable to the townhome development since the proposed development had since been considerably scaled back.  He noted the secondary access along 134th Avenue was not included in the covenant because the applicant was uncertain as to what the new County Code would require. Commissioner Jordan reviewed the amendment made to the County Code pertaining to secondary points of entrance and exit and suggested passing the item to allow the applicant to address the concerns expressed by Commissioner Levine Cava. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Levine Cava and Mr. Mayol regarding the primary entrance/exit for the community and subsequent secondary/emergency ingress and egress points. Commissioner Levine Cava restated the motion to defer the foregoing application.  This motion was seconded by Commissioner Diaz and upon being put to a vote, failed 8-4 (Commissioners Higgins, Martinez, Moss, Souto, Bovo, Diaz, Vice Chairwoman Sosa and Chairwoman Edmonson voted ï¿½noï¿½; Commissioners Jordan, Monestime, Suarez, Levine Cava voted ï¿½yesï¿½; Commissioner Heyman was absent). Commissioner Jordan suggested revisiting the item later in the meeting to allow the applicant to address Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s concerns. Mr. Mayol explained the proffered declaration of restrictions was already signed by the applicant so any modifications would require an additional thirty to sixty days to finalize.  He contended a deferral was not necessary since the plat would return to the Board and at that time all commitments and representations would be included in the plat. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out the motion to defer had failed so no action was taken on the application. Commissioner Levine Cava moved to approve the application, per staff recommendation, with a condition that the commitment related to 134th Avenue be included in the final covenant.  This motion was seconded by Vice Chairwoman Sosa. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the foregoing application sought a district boundary change with a covenant attached and cautioned the Board members that the case law did not permit conditions to a boundary change since the condition would not be enforceable. Upon the conclusion of extensive discussions on the foregoing application, Commissioner Levine Cava moved to approve the application, per staff recommendation, with an amendment to the proffered covenant to ensure a turn lane was built and every effort made to locate the entrance/exit for the development on 184th Street subject to the County Code. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Sosa and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-11-20.

Responding to Commissioner Bovoï¿½s question regarding the traffic plan for the proposed development, Mr. Kogon noted the application was reviewed by the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) and pointed out the applicant had proffered  a traffic operation plan which would be included as part of the approval of the application. Commissioner Diaz voiced his support for the item. Commissioner Levine Cava inquired about the traffic mitigation plan.

Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced that there was one speaker registered to speak in support of the foregoing application, however that speaker was no longer present. Commissioner Monestime announced that he briefly stepped away during consideration of the last application but had since returned. Mr. Michael (Mickey) Marrero, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin & Tapanes, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 300, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Yes Properties 13300 Memorial Inc., and provided a brief review of the application, project description and project history. There being no speakers registered and present to speak on the application, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Commissioner Monestime stated while he was in favor of the application, he was concerned about the additional traffic generated during school hours and asked whether approval of the application could be conditioned to require a police officer to help direct/monitor traffic. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel noted there were numerous conditions proposed by staff regarding continued County jurisdiction over the traffic operation plan (TOP) for the school. Mr. Kogon stated he could not confirm whether the traffic operation plan included/required a police officer based on the student count and deferred to Ms. Claudia Diaz, Division Chief for Traffic Division,  Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW). Chairwoman Edmonson commented that she believed it was the schoolï¿½s responsibility to hire police officers to monitor and regulate traffic. Ms. Diaz confirmed that it was the responsibility of the school to provide officers as needed.  She pointed out that the TOP remained unchanged and did not include an officer. Commissioner Sosa stated she would support the application if the school agreed to pay for an officer. Mr. Marrero noted while the existing TOP did not specifically require a police officer, the school had already hired an off-duty officer to help during the dismissal period.  He noted in addition to the off-duty officer, there were four staff members also assisting with the dismissal process. Mr. Marrero also noted that the school had relocated the drop off area inside the property which would hopefully mitigate some of the traffic congestion on the street. Commissioner Diaz voiced his support for the application with the condition that an off-duty officer be present during the dismissal process. Commissioner Martinez expressed his support for the item with the provision that an off-duty officer be hired to help direct traffic during school hours. Commissioner Monestime moved to approve the foregoing application, per staff's recommendation and include an additional condition that the school provide an off-duty police officer to direct traffic during the dismissal process.

He noted the applicant accepted staffï¿½s recommendation for a modified approval to limit the use to fast food restaurants and reassured the Board members that the limited usage would not allow for the sale/service of alcohol on the property. Mr. Vazquez, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, reviewed the proposed site and landscaping plans and argued both plans illustrate there would be no intrusion into the neighborhood as described by the opposing residents. Mr. Kogon advised the Board members that while the applicant reviewed the site and landscaping plans as part of his presentation to the Board, no formal plans were submitted with the application for staff review. Commissioner Diaz stated while he did not take issue with a ï¿½24 hourï¿½ restaurant he was concerned about social gatherings in the area at late hours and asked if there was any plan in place to prohibit this from occurring. Mr. Kogon noted staff was aware that the applicant sought to build a ï¿½Checkersï¿½ fast food restaurant but no other details were provided.

DEFERRED ITEMS A 200102 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: \tZ2017000338 --  DISTRICT(S) 7 -- APPLICANT: NORTHEASTERN GOLF, LLC AND FORT DALLAS GOLF CLUB, LTD. -- SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANTS ARE REQUESTING THE PARTIAL RELEASE OF A RESTRICTION AS RECORDED IN OFFICIAL RECORD BOOK 5891, PAGE 633, WHICH LIMITED THE USE OF THE PROPERTY TO A GOLF COURSE, CLUB HOUSE AND ANCILLARY USES.  --  LOCATION: \t9400 SW 130 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-21-20 Mover: Xavier L. Suarez Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 9 - 3 No: Sosa , Cava , Martinez Absent: Jordan REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) read the item into the record. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel provided an introductory statement in light of the complexities of the issues relating to this application.  He reported this application had a complicated history because the covenant was the subject of a pending litigation between the owners of the subject property, the adjacent property owners and the County.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced the covenant restricted the subject property to only a golf course, and a country club with certain associated uses and does not allow development in accordance with the underlying ï¿½GUï¿½ zoning interim district.  He explained the covenant was recorded in 1968 to comply with a condition for an unusual use of approval for a golf course.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out under section 33-313.1 of the Code, because this application would delete a declaration of restricted covenant or development agreement that was submitted in connection with a prior zoning agreement, it would result in the increase or density of the use and could only be approved with a 2/3 votes of the members present.  He imparted additional background information concerning the covenant, since this covenant differed from the covenants normally approved by the Board.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated the covenant was not proffered as part of a rezoning application and he noted it was not necessary to deal with site specific issues, and the covenant issue extended beyond what the zoning appeals board resolution required when it approved the unusual use. He indicated the immediate consequences of releasing the covenant today, meant the property would be able to be developed in accordance with the underlying ï¿½GUï¿½ zoning district regulation and as pointed out in the staff analysis that consisted of a maximum of approximately 30 estate density units.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel commented the second consequence would mean releasing the covenant changed the open space requirements applicable to any future zoning applications for the subject property and any application would require a public hearing.  He advised the only question before the Board was the following:  would releasing the covenant and allowing the property to be developed in the underlying zoning district, be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and otherwise satisfy this Boardï¿½s standard for covenant modifications which generally related to impacts on public purpose and infrastructure, public safety and avoiding excessive overcrowding and nuisances.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel mentioned because this involved a covenant additional principles of background law were also relevant to deliberation.  He informed the Commission; consent of the adjacent property owners were not required before this Board released the covenant.  He added as set out in the staff recommendation, the applicants have contained the required number of consents of the property owners and the consents have been reviewed.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reminded the members of the Board and informed the public any decisions made, must be rendered on substantial confident evidence and reiterated the only request before the Board today was the release of the covenant. He urged everyone testifying today to focus their comments only on the impacts of the pending application. The Clerk of the Board Director Melissa Adames swore in all of the witnesses for this item. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to public comments and the following persons appeared telephonically: The following speakers were opposed to the release of the covenant: 1. \tMr. Alex Pardo, 12941 SW Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 2. \tMr. Brian Wacker, 5600 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 3. \tMs. Amanda Prieto, 13990 SW 91st Terrace, Miami, FL 4. \tMs. Amina Dowd, 10137 East Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 5. \tMs. Amer Cabrera 9301 West Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 6. \tMs. Ana Batista, 9905 East Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 7. \tMs. Ana Reyes Taylor, 8950 SW 133rd Place, Miami, FL 8. \tMs. Ana Pardo, 12941 South Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 9. \tMr. Anthony Pardo, 12941 South Calusa Club Drive, Miami, FL 10. \tMr. Christian Atkins, 10260 SW 130th Avenue, Miami, FL 11. \tMs. Cindy Lerner, 5901 Moss Ranch Road, Pinecrest, Miami, FL 12.

He announced the covenant would expire in 2067 and those in support of releasing the covenant were the ring lot owners which have been promised $300,000 for their signatures if and when the covenant was released.  Mr. Winker advised the release of the covenant would result in the development of over 550 planned homes that would have a significant impact on the surrounding communities, area schools, the environment and first responder resources.  He specified for the record; the required number of consents have not been obtained and the 75% threshold has not been reached as asserted by the developer.  In closing Mr. Winker urged the commission to look at all of the stakeholders in this situation and make a decision that was sensible for all of the neighboring districts by voting no on the release of the restrictive covenant. Ms. Eileen Mehta, attorney for the applicant, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, commented if this application were approved it would settle the eight (8) yearlong litigation among the adjacent homeowners, the County and the applicant.  She explained this hearing would only deal with the release of the covenant.  Ms. Mehta asked the Board to preserve for the record any testimony or objection which fell outside of the scope of the advertised notice for this hearing and this application.  She proceeded to review a slideshow presentation as followed: ï¿½\t1968 Restriction ï¿½\t84% Approved Removal of Restriction ï¿½\tWould releasing the Restriction cause: Ms. Mehta introduced the following witnesses to provide testimony to the Board: Mr. Dick Norwalk, Vice-President of GL Homes, 1600 Sawgrass Corporate Parkway, Sunrise, FL, announced consistent with the requirements to the 1968 covenant restrictions and the direction of the Board, consent was received from 84% of the ring lot owners. He clarified this hearing was to address the removal of a restriction and the settlement of a lawsuit.   Mr. Norwalk continued with the slideshow presentation: ï¿½\tFACT #1 ï¿½\tPictures of the surrounding area ï¿½\tFACT #2 ï¿½\t1968 Restriction ï¿½\tFACT #3 ï¿½\tFACT #4 Mr. Norwalk mentioned the Board and the presiding judge over the litigation urged GL Homes and the ring lot owners to resolve the covenant issue and he noted a resolution was achieved.  He informed the Board based on these urgings they currently have consent from 84% of the ring lot owners, who were the most impacted parties and he asked the Board to approve the removal of the restriction. Dr. Hank Fishkind, 12051 Corporate Blvd, Orlando, FL, advised he had a Ph.D. in economics and possessed over 40 years of experience helping clients develop master plan communities across South Florida and have consulted with clients concerning the economics of golf courses.  He mentioned he examined this particular golf course and indicated his analysis of the economics of this course included a visit to the site and review with management and in his professional opinion, the Calusa golf property could not be operated as a stand-alone golf course.  Dr. Fishkind commented although data indicated the golf industry has stabilized, he opined there may be permanent impacts to the economy as well as transitory effects due to the Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Mr. Tucker Gibbs appeared before the Board representing the Save Calusa Trust, which consisted of a majority of the homeowners within 150 feet of and bordering the golf course.  He advised all parties reached a settlement that was fair, reasonable and worthy of releasing the covenant restriction. Mr. Gibbs added pointed out the only matter before the Board today was the release of the covenant.  He added the homeowners who opposed the release of the covenant were not the ring lot owners who have been engaged in litigation for the past eight years, nor do they own the right to release the restriction.  Mr. Gibbs announced staff evaluated the application and determined it met the approval requirement within the zoning code and he urged the Board to follow staff recommendation and approve this application to release the covenant restrictions. Mr. Brian May, 235 Catalonia Avenue, Coral Gables, FL, appeared before the Board representing the Save Calusa Trust, and announced 84% of the homeowners representing 123 ring lot properties had signed releases to lift the restriction on the property.  Mr. May concluded by pointing out that lifting the restriction would not allow for more than 32 homes on the property and any proposed development of more than 32 homes would require a rezoning application to be submitted to the County and the community to ensure all concerns were properly addressed.  He urged the Board to lift the restriction as recommended by staff. In closing, Ms. Mehta commented the only matter before the Board was the release of the restriction and she noted the importance of the approval of the application included all parties following the directive of the Board; settling eight (8) years of time-consuming litigation;  and removing uncertainty and potentially wasted expenses for the applicant and ring lot owners.  She asked the Board to waive the six (6) month filing period provision, to allow the applicant time to prepare and present an application for a plan of development and to support staff recommendation and approve the application. There being no other persons to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Commissioner Suarez stated, for the record, he occasionally saw messages on social media concerning this application and he also mentioned he read an article in todayï¿½s Miami Herald, but noted he did not go into the merits of the case due to the Jennings rule.  He suggested the County Attorneyï¿½s office introduce legislation to provide clarification to public officials regarding their ability to exchange views with people on social media, notwithstanding the Jennings rule. In response to the question asked by Commissioner Suarez, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated this covenant was specific and consent for the release of the covenant was only required from the ring lot owners and this Board.  He announced the approval of this hearing would allow the property to revert to the GU- zoning district, which would allow for the development of approximately 30 properties and he added this was not a public park and was not included in the application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised this covenant was accepted by the County; therefore, the County had to verify all requirements were met. Mr. Kogon advised if the application were approved today, the next step would be the platting process, which would come before the Board and all impacts on the approximate 30 units would be analyzed.  He stated should the applicant seek more than the approximate 30 units, then a full zoning hearing before the Board would be required, which included a rezoning application and all impacts would be analyzed based on the information submitted with the application.  He reported the department was allowed to trend ï¿½GUï¿½- zoning, which meant the director had the ability to examine the geographic area and the existing zoning and development in the neighborhood and apply the equivalent zoning district to the trend of the development in the neighborhood.  However, Mr. Kogon noted if a trend did not exist then it would revert back to EU-2.  He stated this area had a wide range of zoning districts and in his opinion, there was no clear trend of development, therefore he would only allow the EU-2 code. Responding to Commissioner Sosa, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the covenant filed after the hearing by the developer in reference to the golf course exceeded the requirements of the hearing. Mr. Kogon informed the Board that the notarized signatures received from the existing ring lot owners were verified with the Property Appraiserï¿½s office, as well as the deeds, and in some cases the owners recorded their covenants with the Clerk of Court.  He stated the signatures were cross referenced on the date received and they were also cross referenced several days before this meeting Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the 12 consents received several years ago were recorded in the public record and subsequent purchasers of the property received notice of those consents and he announced more than 75% of the consents received were current property owner.  He mentioned it was the Boardï¿½s practice that a consent was considered final and valid upon receipt. Commissioner Sosa expressed concerned about the maintenance and the up keep of the property and she also mentioned the owners who moved without disclosing that information. In response to a series of questions asked by Commissioner Heyman, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the only legal requirement to advise a future buyer of the covenant from 1968 was the document itself and he added this covenant did not appear in the chain of title of any of the ring lot owners, it was only ever in the chain of title for the golf course property itself.  He mentioned the covenants were recorded in the chain of title for those properties sold a long time ago and copies of all of the consents reviewed and verified by the County were maintained in the zoning hearing file.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel commented if the County did not respect the covenant waiver by the private property owners, any land use decisions made by the Board could become the subject of such an action.  He noted if approved by the sponsor, a condition of approval could be added that the property shall not be trended pursuant to 33-196 and only be developed at a further zoning hearing according to the minimum standards of the EU-2 district which would codify the statement put on the record earlier by the zoning director. Commissioner Heyman noted her support for the application with staff recommendation along with a friendly amendment to limit development to approximately 30 homes. Commissioner Martinez expressed concern regarding future development once the covenant was released and the potential impacts to the neighborhood.  He noted his opposition to the release of the covenant and suggested the County consider buying the property, make it a special taxing district and convert the land to a park. In response to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question regarding the applicant being held accountable to the 50% open space requirement, Mr. Kogon replied the comps plan for parks and recreation was specific in guiding the redevelopment of golf courses, but in this case the open space was not used for any density calculation on the adjacent residential areas and was never used as a set aside in those areas.  He stated the 50% did not apply and the release would allow the property owner to develop consistent with the existing zoning and density requirements of parks and recreation in the surrounding area.  Mr. Kogon stated he was not asked for a formal trend request and announced on the record he did not see a trend of development; therefore, it would remain in the same GU zoning district, allowing the development of 30 units. Responding to Commissioner Levine Cavaï¿½s question concerning the Boardï¿½s obligation or discretion to release the covenant once 75% of consents have been received and verified; Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the Board was not required to release the covenant, but in consideration the Board would be governed by the standards set forth in the code for modification or release of a covenant. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified these applications differed because the last time the applicant appeared before the Board was for a Comprehensive Development Plan (CDMP) amendment, proposing to change the designation from a parks and recreation to a residential category which would have allowed more units to be built.  He noted when the CDMP application failed, the applicant and the ring lot owners engaged in negotiations and filed this zoning application which was vastly different from the original application, because this application only relates to the release of the covenant.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reported this application could not be handled in CDMP, since it was a zoning covenant, therefore a zoning hearing was required. In response to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question regarding the certification of collected signatures, Mr. Kogon stated the Development Services Division of the ï¿½RERï¿½ Department asked for notarized signatures, cross referenced with the property appraiserï¿½s office and ensured everyone listed on the deed signed the consent.  Regarding the matter of trend versus need, Mr. Kogon reported trending was purely a zoning analysis and he announced he did not have the ability to look at need when trending.  He stated the need usually occurred at the time of the land use decision and he informed the Board of the rules and regulations for trending.  Mr. Kogon indicated in this case there was a subjective analysis of the neighborhood and the use, which ranged from high to medium density residential and therefore was difficult to trend.  He reiterated based on the historic use of the property, the CDMP guidelines for such properties and the limited density that could be developed, the application was recommended for approval by the department. In response to Commissioner Higgins, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel announced if the Board rejected the application, the litigation would continue, and a decision would be made by the court. In reference to the suggestion made by Commissioner Higgins to direct any future applications to provide for open space, Mr. Kogon stated those requests should be made based on the nature of the development, at the time of the zoning hearing and during the public hearing process. Commissioner Diaz inquired about the negotiation process, and Mr. Gibbs, attorney for the Save Calusa Trust mentioned the request made by the Board for all parties to reach a settlement.  He explained the developer met with his clients, the property owners abutting the golf course for two and a half years before reaching a solution. Commissioner Martinez declared the release of the covenant would affect his district more than district 7. Hearing no further comments or questions, the Board proceeded to approve the application pursuant to staff's recommendation along with approval of the waiver request. The foregoing Resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-21-20. 1/23/2020 Deferred by the Zoning Board 2/20/2020 Carried over by the Zoning Board CURRENT ITEMS 1 202188 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH:\tZ2019000200  --  DISTRICT(S): 3  --  APPLICANT(S): \tBROWNSVILLE VILLAGE V, LTD.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): \tTHE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO MODIFY A PRIOR RESOLUTION AND DECLARATION OF RESTRICTIONS IN ORDER TO SUBMIT PLANS SHOWING PHASE-V OF A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT ON THE SUBJECT SITE, WITH INCREASED NUMBER OF UNITS, AND TO ALLOW FUTURE MODIFICATIONS OF SAID COVENANT AS PERMITTED BY CODE.  --  LOCATION: \tLYING ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF NW 29 AVENUE AND NW 53 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-22-20 Mover: Audrey M.

Chairwoman Edmonson opened the floor to public comments and the following persons appeared telephonically and were opposed to rezoning of this land: Ms. Elizabeth Gonzalez, address was not given. Mr. Berkley Ugarte, 7080 SW 79 Terrace, Miami, FL Ms. Damiata Perez, 7770 SW 69 Avenue, Miami, FL Ms. Edith Clark, 7640 SW 71 Avenue, Miami, FL Mr. Eduardo Ramos, 7010 SW 79th Terrace, Miami, FL Ms. Arleen Rock, 8325 SW 72 Avenue, Miami, FL Mr. Peter Napper, 7640 SW 71 Avenue, Miami, FL Ms. Alexis Echevarria, 7843 SW 71st Avenue, Miami, FL City of South Miami Vice Mayor, Bob Welsh, appeared before the Board representing the City of South Miami Commission, and noted a resolution was passed a week ago opposing the rezoning of the land. City of South Miami Commissioner Josh Lehman opposed the rezoning of the land. Mr. Jeffrey Bercow, 200 S. Biscayne Blvd. Miami, attorney for the applicant, advised the applicant would transform a vacant railroad strip into a vibrant transit-oriented development in downtown Kendall urban center. Mr. Bercow reviewed a slide presentation outlining the following information: ï¿½\tZoning Map ï¿½\tUrban Centers - LUE I-45 ï¿½\tCDMP Objective LU-7 ï¿½\tProposed Connection ï¿½\tCDMP-Ludlam Trail ï¿½\tCovenant Height Restriction ï¿½\tCovenant Previous Version ï¿½\tCovenant Open Space ï¿½\tDowntown Kendall Urban Center Mr. Bercow urged the Board to defend the Strategic Mass Area Rapid Transit (SMART) plan and transit-oriented development by approving this application. There being no other persons wishing to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the floor to public comment. Commissioner Suarez announced he was not supportive of the item and made a motion to deny the application. In response to Commissioner Sosa, Mr. Kogon advised in order to encourage modifications to downtown Kendall, this application ensured the proper connection from the Ludlam Trail to the Underline, and he mentioned there was a mandatory green space requirement on the north side of the property. Mr. Kogon explained the covenant guaranteed the entire corridor would be required to provide a connection to the trail and the green space served as a buffer to the community and to the trail. After further discussion Commissioner Suarez withdrew his motion to deny and asked for a deferral of the item. Responding to Chairwoman Edmonsonï¿½s question regarding the impact on the connection between the Ludlam Trail and the Underline, Mr. Kogon stated the approval of this application would require the developer to construct additional bike lanes and walking paths along the east side of the property and connect to the M-Path Underline. Commissioner Heyman opined this project would be good for the Ludlam Trail and expressed concern about deferring the item, due to the incoming new Board members who have not heard the discussions regarding this application and the potential impact to the Underline. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised if the item was deferred today the new commissioners would have to be familiarized with the record prior to voting on this application. Upon hearing further discussion from his colleagues, Commissioner Suarez withdrew his motion to defer and Commissioner Sosa made a motion to approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendations. Hearing no further questions or comments the Board proceeded to approve the application.

Mr. Jorge Navarro, 333 SE 2nd avenue, Miami, attorney for the applicant appeared before the Board and reviewed a slideshow presentation as followed: ï¿½\tMaple Multifamily Land SE ï¿½\tApplication Request ï¿½\tApplication Timeline ï¿½\tExisting Zoning ï¿½\tSurrounding Uses ï¿½\tProximity to Major Employment Hubs ï¿½\tComprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP)   Declaration of Restrictions ï¿½\tVoluntary Declaration ï¿½\tSite Plan ï¿½\tProject Renderings ï¿½\tTraffic Benefits Mr. Navarro noted the applicant received positive staff recommendation and agreed with all of the modified conditions of approval. There being no other persons wishing to speak, Vice Chairwoman Sosa closed the floor to public comment. In response to Vice-Chairwoman Sosaï¿½s question regarding the developer agreeing to upgrade the existing sewer line from 10 inches to 12 inches, Mr. Navarro reported as part of the approval, the applicant would be following all of the recommendations listed in the memorandum. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised a condition could be added that the applicant comply with the recommendation from the Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer department consistent with the memorandum dated March 20, 2020. Mr. Kogon explained the Costco site consisted of 72- acres which included parcels that were not subject to this existing application due to a past development order. He added the application referenced the existing shopping center and added new residential units in addition to the 325 units listed, which totaled 681 units in the area to be developed.  Mr. Kogon stated by the rezoning of this application, commercial property could no longer be developed at this location.

Acting Chairwoman Sosa opened the public hearing on the foregoing application. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced that there were five speakers registered to speak on the item. The following persons appeared before the Board: 1.\tMs. Sadie McMillan, 24611 SW 137th Avenue, Miami FL, voiced her concerns about the use of   smaller trees for the sound barrier and stated she would prefer for the larger trees to be used instead.  She also commented on the sale of alcohol on the subject property and suggested hiring additional police officers to patrol and monitor the area. 2.\tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the item, specifically the sale of alcohol. 3.\tMr. Tallman Whitler, 12811 SW 218th Terrace, Miami FL, spoke in opposition of the item and the sale of alcohol on the site. There being no other persons registered to speak, Acting Chairwoman Sosa closed the public hearing. Mr. Bill Riley, 1671 NW 16th Terrace, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant Redland Market Village, Inc. and provided a brief PowerPoint presentation highlighting the overall site plan for the proposed development. Acting Chairwoman Sosa voiced her concerns about applicant request number 10 for a special exception to permit cocktail lounges or bars to be spaced less than the required 2,500 feet from schools and religious facilities and to be spaced less than the required 1,500 feet from other alcohol uses, particularly in light of the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to 3 religious facilities and one charter school situated in the area. Mr. Kogon reviewed the applicantï¿½s requests related to alcohol sales and explained that while the applicantï¿½s request to sell alcohol on a Sunday was not an usual request, staff determined the subject propertyï¿½s location (west side of US-1) was sufficiently isolated from the religious facilities and school located in the area (east of US-1) to grant special exception request number 10. Acting Chairwoman Sosa reiterated her concerns related to the cocktail lounges and bars component of the proposed development. Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ question as to whether the foregoing application sought to increase density, Mr. Kogon clarified that the proposed development would not increase density or intensity on the subject property.  He noted the application sought to manage and reorganize the internal layout of the entire project and included a development proposal for a small portion of the subject property.  Mr. Kogon further explained that approval of the application would provide a more cohesive plan for the overall long term development as well as allow for the development on the small portion of property as outlined in the applicantï¿½s presentation.  He noted the proposed plan was consistent with the existing density of the project and pointed out while the applicant could theoretically develop the property on a grander scale administratively, the proposed development plan would lock in a density below the allowable maximum. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated she believed the foregoing application and proposed development would provide the Redland area much needed economic growth and opportunity without a negative impact on the community. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application and the foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-26-20. 2 202467 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000092  --  DISTRICT(S) 5  --  APPLICANT: MIAMI-DADE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICATION IS REQUESTING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR A GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR TWO COUNTY-OWNED PROPERTIES, LOCATED IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE GOVERNMENT CENTER METRORAIL STATION AND DESIGNATED AS PART OF THE ''GOVERNMENT CENTER SUBZONE OF THE FIXED GUIDEWAY RAPID TRANSIT ZONE,''ï¿½ TO APPROVE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMITTED USES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 33C-11 OF THE COUNTY CODE.  --  LOCATION: 395 NW 1 STREET AND 25 NW NORTH RIVER DRIVE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved Zoning Z-27-20 Mover: Eileen Higgins Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 12 - 0 Absent: Heyman REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed.

He stated in order for the applicant to build the development within the aforementioned scope, the second parcel of land which was currently designated as Agricultural District (AU) needed to be rezoned to Leisure City Community Urban Center District (LCUCD) with an amendment to designate the subject property as a Mixed Use Corridor (MCD). Addressing the communityï¿½s concerns regarding traffic, building height, parking, recreation/walkability/greenspace, aesthetics and security, Mr. Martos firstly referenced the traffic study commissioned by the applicant prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and noted the report revealed no conflicts. He argued the neighborsï¿½ primary concerns related to the height of the buildings and the aesthetics of the community should be addressed by the buffering provided by the cemetery, church and community center located to the north, south and west of the subject property, as well as the covenant proffered by the applicant which was connected to the land and would restrict the building height to 4 stories, establish a 250 feet buffer from SW 272nd Street, dedicate a roadway to help alleviate traffic congestion, commit to building a crosswalk and construct a roadway through the project site.  Mr. Martos stated the proposed development would provide more parking than required by County Code and noted that the applicant had committed to building 8 feet wide sidewalks with ample landscaping. Mr. Martos spoke about the difficulties encountered in addressing the communityï¿½s concerns regarding the neighborhood aesthetics in the proffered covenant and provided an oral commitment that the applicant would continue to work with staff to improve the aesthetics along the gateway entrance to the proposed development.  He noted that he had also submitted a letter with the same commitment for the record.  Mr. Martos reassured the Board members that the applicant recognized the neighborsï¿½ safety concerns and stated that the applicant would install public lights with the necessary shields to the developer-operator's expense. Mr. Martos pointed out that staff recommended approval of the application and stressed that the application was consistent with the Countyï¿½s Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan goals to create affordable housing near the transit corridors.  He advised the Board members that the application had been thoroughly vetted and the site plan was currently in the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process.  Mr. Martos argued the proposed development was compatible with the neighborhood and reiterated the applicantï¿½s willingness to continue working with the neighbors to address any concerns that may arise. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the application: Mr. Nicholas Dï¿½Ambrosia, 27850 SW 154th Court, Miami FL. Mr. Ernesto Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel requested speakers limit comments in response to the applicantï¿½s presentation. Ms. Lucia Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ and voiced her conditional objection to the application based on the applicantï¿½s inability to include specific beautification commitments in the covenant.  She requested the verbal commitments made by the applicant such as the installation of fountains be memorialized in writing to protect the residents. Ms. Vanessa Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL, echoed the statements made by the previous speaker. Ms. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami FL Chairman Diaz noted that Commissioner Souto had exited the meeting and would announce his return for the record. Mr. Carlyle Webb, 21651 SW 127th Court, Miami FL Mr. Tallman Whitler, 12811 SW 218th Terrace, Miami FL Mr. James Davison, 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami FL, echoed the statements and conditional objection to the application as voiced by Ms. Lucia Echauri. Mr. Efrain Nunez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Homestead FL, indicated his conditional support for the application subject to the incorporation of the applicantï¿½s verbal commitment to include specific public improvements into the design of the development.  He noted that he had met with the applicant several times and acknowledged the compromise and concessions made by the applicant in response to the residentsï¿½ concerns. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the proffered covenant did not include a site plan, hence the absence of beautification concepts and amenities communicated to the neighbors.  He reviewed the elements included in the proffered covenant and noted a site plan was not required for the rezoning process. Mr. Martos pointed out the verbal commitments made to the residents regarding the projectsï¿½ amenities and beautification elements have been memorialized in the form of a letter dated January 11, 2021 and was included in the Zoning application ï¿½kitï¿½.  He acknowledged that several verbal commitments were not included in the covenant and explained that certain commitments, such as the adoption of a bus stop; as suggested by a resident; needed to be developed and finalized with staff since no such program currently exists.  Mr. Martos noted the aesthetics component was not included in the covenant because of the strict timeline and guidelines associated with affordable housing projects and reiterated the applicantï¿½s oral and written commitment (letter dated January 11, 2021) to ensure an acceptably contextual design for the entrance gateway.  He stated other beautification elements such as the installation of fountains, wall murals or sculptures still needed to be finalized hence the reason they were not included in the covenant. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out that the covenant made no mention of the project being an affordable housing development and as such was not required as part of the zoning approval. Mr. Martos clarified that while todayï¿½s zoning approval was not contingent on the affordable housing component, the applicant had already submitted the ASPR application and noted that part of the application included confirmation from the Florida Housing Finance Corporation that the applicant had secured funding to build affordable housing units on the subject property. Mr. Martos verbally assured the Board members of the applicantï¿½s intent to construct affordable housing units on the subject site and that the applicant was in receipt of funding to do so. Responding to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ question as to distance of the subject property from the new South Dade bus stops, Mr. Martos stated that while the subject parcels were located across the street from two (2) existing bus stops, he didnï¿½t believe either of the bus stops were being considered for the new terminals. Commissioner McGhee inquired about the density of the proposed development. Mr. Martos explained the proposed development would house a total of 342 units across both sites and clarified the application before the Board only pertained to Parcel 2, which would comprise of 132 units. Commissioner Cohen Higgins thanked the residents for appearing before the Board and voicing their concerns.  She commended the applicant for meeting with the residents and acknowledged their willingness to continued dialogue.  Commissioner Cohen Higgins spoke about the concessions made to date by the applicant and indicated her support for the item based on the Countyï¿½s prioritization of the SMART plan and the applicantï¿½s representation that the development would provide much needed affordable housing along the South Dade transit corridor. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staff recommendation, and the foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-1-21. 12/17/2020 Deferred by the Zoning Board APPEAL ITEM 1 210350 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2019000183  --  DISTRICT(S) 7  --  APPLICANT: CRISTOBAL & LOUISE SOTOLONGO  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANTS ARE SEEKING APPROVAL TO PERMIT A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM EU-1, SINGLE-FAMILY ONE ACRE ESTATE DISTRICT, TO EU-S, SINGLE- FAMILY SUBURBAN ESTATE DISTRICT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO PERMIT TWO LOTS EACH WITH VARIANCES OF THE EU-1 LOT AREA, LOT AREA COVERAGE, LOT DEPTH AND SETBACK FROM FRONT ENCROACHMENT.  --  LOCATION: 7420 SW 71ST AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-2-21 Mover: Raquel A.

Mr. Jorge Navarro, GreenbergTraurig, 333 SE 2nd Avenue, Miami FL appeared on behalf of the applicant, 9300 US Investment Holdings, LLC., and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation provided a brief review of the application highlighting details of the proposed project, rendering of the building design, phased plan to address easement issue and plans to replace the existing sign.  He noted the applicant had met with the two (2) residents who initially opposed the project but was now in support of the application and noted staff recommended approval with conditions. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and there being no one registered or appearing to speak, closed the public hearing. Commissioner Sosa (via Zoom) voiced her concerns regarding the lack of adequate parking spaces and requested clarification as to staffï¿½s comments that the application would impact water and sewer services and bring additional noise into the area. Mr. Kogon explained the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to the Dadeland South Station effectuated the Kendall Zoning Code which provided for a full reduction in parking if a property was located within 500 feet of Downtown Kendall and other Rapid Transit Zones (RTZ).  He pointed out the applicantï¿½s parking allocation was within the Code. Responding to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s request for clarification as to staffï¿½s comments regarding the applicationï¿½s impact on water and sewer services, Mr. Kogon stated staffï¿½s comments were standard for any application requesting a density increase and noted the Water and Sewer Department recommended approval of the application.  He clarified the report did not specify a negative impact and explained the applicant would be required to enter into a Water and Sewer agreement to provide for the infrastructure to satisfy the increased demand. Commissioner Sosa inquired whether there was adequate ï¿½hookupï¿½ capacity for the development. Mr. Kogon directed the Board members attention to Page 21 of the Water and Sewer memorandum which confirmed there was adequate transmission and plant capacity at the time of the request. Commissioner Regalado spoke about the Countyï¿½s prioritization of development along RTZs and stated while she initially did not envision the building of a storage facility on the subject property, she believed the hotel component would attract additional density to the area. Commissioner Regalado stated while she commended the projectï¿½s elevated design and use of outdoor space for dining, she believed the landscaping around the building was sparse and needed improvement.  She requested the applicant consider including more landscaping to increase the aesthetic appeal of the project. Mr. Navarro concurred that there was enough space in the design to incorporate more landscaping and agreed to install 50% more landscaping utilizing onsite trees; than required by the County Code. Commissioner Regalado accepted the additional condition proffered by the applicant to install 50% more landscaping than required by County Code. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the item per staff recommendation and with the acceptance of the additional condition proffered by the applicant to install 50% more landscaping than required by the County Code. This motion was seconded by Vice Chairman Gilbert and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-4-21. 2 210353 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000089  --  DISTRICT(S) 8  --  APPLICANT: SOUTH MIAMI DADE FARMERS, LLC  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM RU-1 AND AU TO MCD.  --  LOCATION: LYING AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF SW 296 STREET AND SW 159 AVENUE, MIAMI- DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-5-21 Mover: Danielle Cohen Higgins Seconder: Oliver G.

Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, South Miami Dade Farmers, LLC., and provided a brief description of the subject property including the location of the subject parcel. He explained the applicant was seeking a district boundary change from Single-Family Residential District (RU-1) and Agricultural District (AU) to Mixed-Use Corridor District (MCD).  Mr. Vazquez stated the applicant sought to develop six (6), three (3) storied multi-family buildings comprising of 321 residential units on the subject property.  He indicated the proposed development would include a mix of one (1), two (2) and three (3) bedroom units along with recreational amenities in compliance with the Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan regulations established by the Board of County Commission (Board/BCC) and noted there were no variance requests as the proposed development met with all the MCD requirements including but not limited to parking, setbacks and sidewalk width. Mr. Vazquez recognized staffï¿½s extensive Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) analysis and contended the redesignation of the subject property to MCD zoning allowed for development consistent with the Boardï¿½s vision under the SMART Plan and in keeping with the CDMP. Mr. Vazquez with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation highlighted the location of the subject property and renderings of the proposed development.  He requested the Board approve the foregoing application pursuant to staffï¿½s recommendation to approve with acceptance of the proffered covenant. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and there being no one wishing to speak, closed the public hearing. Commissioner Cohen Higgins commented that the proposed project was consistent with the Countyï¿½s SMART Plan for development along transit corridors and indicated her support for the item.

Biscayne Boulevard, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, 191 SW 12 Owner LLC., an affiliate of JDS Development Group, and the co-applicant, City of Miami.   She proceeded to the review the application and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation provided a brief summary of the project highlighting specifics of the proposed project identified as ï¿½1 Southside Park.ï¿½  Ms. Tapanes Llahues noted she was joined by Mr. Michael Stern, Principal Owner of JDS Development Group; Mr. Isaiah King, Project Director at SHoP Architects and Ms. Isabel Castilla, Principal, James Corner Field Operations, along with several other architects and engineers comprising the design and development team for the proposed project. Ms. Tapanes Llahues reviewed the subject property location and surrounding uses.  She noted the proposed project was a visionary collaboration between the City of Miami and the developer and was unanimously approved by the City of Miami Commission in February 2020.  Ms. Tapanes Llahues explained that the Block 85 Public Benefit Agreement (PBA) exchanged city owned land (current fire station (4) location) and transferred density from Southside Park.  She reviewed the financial benefits of the land transfer and details of the project components. Mr. Isaiah King, Project Director at SHoP Architects, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation reviewed the plans for development of the ï¿½1 Southside Parkï¿½ (hereafter referred to as Southside Park) project and explained the intent and vision of the development.  He noted the proposed project would improve pedestrian access and connectivity to the Underline and Brickell transit stations and included an urban gateway to the development referred to as the ï¿½Paseo.ï¿½  Mr. King explained the ï¿½Paseoï¿½ was intended to be a greenway space with direct pedestrian access through Southside Park to the metro-rail and other transit opportunities along SW 1st Court.  He reviewed plans for the new fire station (Fire Station #4) and key design elements of the proposed project. Mr. King reported the project was envisioned to serve as a mixed-use program with approximately 1000 residential units, a 200 room hotel, 200,000 square feet of office space, 110,000 square feet of commercial wellness retail and a parking garage with 125 spots set aside for public use pursuant to the PBA. Ms. Isabel Castilla, Principal, James Corner Field Operations, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation reviewed the current Southside Park location and features. She described the projectï¿½s plans to expand the existing public park facilities and create a new dog park; and provided renderings for the new space highlighting key design elements.  Ms. Castilla spoke about plans to better integrate the existing school house with the public park, the Underline and the ï¿½Paseo.ï¿½ Ms. Tapanes Llahues concluded the presentation by providing a summary of the economic impact of the proposed project including the applicantï¿½s local workforce hiring commitments and community outreach efforts. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board: Ms. Christine Rupp, Executive Director for Dade Heritage Trust (DHT), 190 SE 12th Terrace, Miami FL, commented on DHTï¿½s vested interest in the historic school located on the subject property.  She noted DHT secured approximately $1 million in funding in 2003/2004 to relocate and restore the historic school house but due to closure of the park after being deemed toxic, the building has remained untouched and was now being used as a storage area by the City of Miami. Ms. Rupp stated while she appreciated the beautiful park plans/renderings for the proposed project, the public benefits agreement did not include language requiring the developer to protect, restore, enhance or maintain and program the school house as a viable asset of the park.  She acknowledged the complexity of the project and requested the County work with and/or require the developer to collaborate with DHT to restore and activate the building as an asset.  Ms. Rupp stated while the developer maintained open dialogue with DHT to date; and noted that she was scheduled to meet with the developerï¿½s historic consultant later today; she believed more substantial language ï¿½requiringï¿½ specific action from the developer would be needed to implement a plan. Ms. Michelle Ruiz, Property Manager for Vue at Brickell Condominium Association, 1250 S. Miami Avenue, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the Vue Board of Directors and requested the application be deferred to allow for further discussion with residents regarding the project. Mr. Nick Nicola, 2819 Muskegon Way, West Palm Beach FL, appeared in support of the application and spoke about the benefits of the project to the community. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. In response to some of the comments made by the speakers, Ms. Tapanes Llahues, clarified that the school house was required to be preserved and reassured the Board members that the building would remain safe during construction.  She noted that the City of Miami was scheduled to return before the Countyï¿½s Historic Preservation Board to discuss faï¿½ade improvements and added that the City of Miami would also be responsible for program development, as recorded in the public benefit agreement.  Ms. Tapanes Llahues indicated the programming would be done upon completion of the restoration of the building. Addressing Ms. Ruizï¿½s comments, Ms. Tapanes Llahues, reassured the Board members that the applicant would contact the Vue Board of Directors to discuss the project.  She highlighted the applicantï¿½s efforts to engage the community and stated that the applicant remained committed to continued dialogue with the residents throughout the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process. Commissioner Higgins stated while she recognized the benefits of the project, she was concerned about utilizing the park as a construction staging area, as stated in the PBA entered into by the City of Miami. Ms. Tapanes Llahues explained that the PBA required the developer to construct a new fire station prior to obtaining any other permits associated with the mixed-use development.  She stated once the construction of the new station was complete, if there was not sufficient parking for fire station personnel, the applicant anticipated utilizing the southwest portion of the park to accommodate for this purpose.  Ms. Tapanes Llahues indicated that the applicant would make all efforts to secure off-site parking however the final decision remained with the City Manager (City of Miami) pursuant to the PBA. Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out that the PBA also included language ensuring Southside Park remained open, aside from areas actively being worked on.  She stated that it was the applicantï¿½s (City of Miami) intent that residents would be able to utilize The Underlineï¿½s ï¿½Brickell Backyardï¿½ once it reopened next week to compensate for any portions of the Southside Park closed for renovations. Commissioner Higgins stressed that the neighborhood only had one park and reiterated her concerns about utilizing the park for parking.  She identified a parking lot in the vicinity that could be used for fire station personnel parking and restated her apprehensions regarding the PBA allowing construction vehicles access to the park. Responding to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request for clarification regarding the conditions listed in the PBA pertaining to construction vehicles having access to the park, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel confirmed that the agreement allowed for use of portions of the park for construction activities and was not limited to just the fire department.  He added that access to the park remained at the discretion of the City Manager and not the developer.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that the County maintained regulatory jurisdiction and was not bound by the terms of the PBA in the event there were concerns about the impacts of the development. Commissioner Higgins inquired from the developer if there were any other options to ensure the park was not utilized as a parking option or for construction staging. Discussion ensued between Chairman Diaz and Commissioner Higgins regarding the developerï¿½s intent to use the park for construction staging purposes. Ms. Tapanes Llahues clarified that while it was not the intent of the applicant to utilize the park for construction staging, the City of Miami would ultimately decide which portion of the park would be used by the fire department for parking.  She stated that the applicant anticipated the fire department utilizing a small area in the southwest portion of the park abutting the new fire station building to accommodate parking for fire station personnel in the event other off-site parking was not available.  Ms. Tapanes Llahues reiterated the final decision remained with the City of Miami Manager in consultation with the Chief of the fire department and reassured the Board members that there were additional protections included in the PBA which required the park and specifically the playground to remain open unless the areas were being worked on. Commissioner Higgins requested input from the County Attorneyï¿½s Office to ensure the park would not be used for personnel parking or construction staging. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated while the PBA required the park to remain open unless an area was actively being worked on, it was within the Boardï¿½s authority to impose an additional condition to limit the use of the park to allow for parking for fire personnel on the southwest portion of the park and only in the event there were no other parking options available offsite. Mr. Michael Stern, Developer, 429 Lenox Avenue, Miami Beach FL, spoke about the challenging phasing component of the project, particularly associated with the construction of the new fire station.  He explained the Fire Chief and fire department believed parking along the same block was necessary for quick access due to life and safety concerns; and reassured the Board members that parking for the fire station personnel would be limited to the southwest portion of the park which was currently devoid of any planned programming.  Mr. Stern pointed out that the playground and basketball court would remain open and accessible to the public during the duration of the construction period (12 to 18 months). Commissioner Higgins reiterated her desire to include language which would allow fire personnel parking to the southwest portion of the park only in the event no other viable options were available. She noted the parking facility she had in mind for use was actually located closer to the fire station.  Commissioner Higgins spoke about the Countyï¿½s policies related to green spaces and argued against limiting public access to an already small park. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel revisited the proposed language for the additional condition. Mr. Stern cautioned the Board members that staging of construction vehicles at the subject site was necessary to the completion of the project. Commissioner Higgins concurred that the construction vehicles should be given access to areas during active construction. Referencing the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) memorandum, Commissioner Higgins inquired whether the areaï¿½s need for pedestrian crosswalk and additional vehicular infrastructure would be addressed during the ASPR process. Mr. Kogon explained the ASPR process would analyze the needs of the community in conjunction with the completed traffic study. Commissioner Higgins contended that the DTPW recommendation did not address the areaï¿½s pedestrian and vehicular needs. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Higgins and Mr. Kogon regarding Rapid Transit Zones (RTZs) and the ASPR process. Commissioner Higgins requested additional information regarding the proposed plans for 11th/12th Street and asked if the site plan included specifics for pavement improvements and landscaping. Mr. Kogon clarified that the plans were conceptual in nature and briefly reviewed design and connectivity elements of the project.  He noted there was an opportunity on the north side of the proposed development, along SW 11th Street, for the developer to provide additional landscape and hardscape to provide additional connectivity to the park, transit and other underlying infrastructure. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Higgins and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding her request for the recommendations proffered by Mr. Kogon, pertaining to the improvements along SW 11th Street, be included as a condition of the itemï¿½s approval. Ms. Tapanes Llahues expressed concerns about having to eliminate on-street parking to accomplish the recommended hardscape/landscape improvements. Commissioner Higgins explained that she wanted the area to be developed in its entirety and development not be limited to the front of the subject property.  She stated that she was satisfied with the recommendations put forth by Mr. Kogon regarding increased pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular access; and noted she had no issue with losing some on-street parking along 11th Street for enhanced sidewalks and increased tree canopy. Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out that 11th Street was a municipal roadway and reassured the Board members that the applicant was amenable to working with the City of Miami and the County to provide the enhanced hardscape and landscaping. Commissioner Higgins stated she envisioned 11th Street providing connectivity to cyclists and pedestrians hence the urgency in ensuring the street was safely designed and developed. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reviewed the proposed language for the supplementary condition that the applicant provide additional hardscaping and landscaping along 11th Street to enhance pedestrian connectivity and safety, to the maximum extent feasible. Commissioner Higgins stressed the importance of ensuring the projectï¿½s design adequately incorporated access and capacity for valet and ride sharing services; and questioned whether the project included micro-mobility parking.  She pointed out there was not enough capacity/school seats to support the application and stated she would continue to advocate to the School Board for the addition of more seats. Responding to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ question regarding the hours of operation for the ï¿½Paseoï¿½, Ms. Tapanes Llahues indicated the area would remain open and noted the City of Miami Parks Department was in the process of creating a pilot program to increase access to other municipal parks beyond the traditional dusk till dawn timeframe. Commissioner Higgins commented on the limitations of the ï¿½Paseoï¿½ design particularly as it affects pedestrian and cyclistsï¿½ access to the train, Underline and park.  Noting the parkï¿½s location, she asked whether there was any provision which would allow the Countyï¿½s Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces (PROS) Director to review the design plans, on an advisory basis, to ensure the proposed landscaping was appropriate as it pertained to deep shadow projections onto the park. Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out that PROS was a part of the Southside Park Working Group and had reviewed the applicantï¿½s landscaping plans for ASPR ï¿½Number 2ï¿½; the plans for just the park.  She noted that the landscaping design for the park did take into account that most of the park would be located in the shade of the surrounding buildings. Commissioner Higgins asked whether the applicant had considered contributing towards the enhancement/improvements of the nearby metro-rail station. Ms. Tapanes Llahues reported that the applicant was currently working with the Countyï¿½s Transit Department and the Friends of the Underline to ensure Southside Park was cohesive with the Underline facility.  She explained the applicant had not proposed any improvements to the Brickell Metro-rail station since it was County-owned and considered ï¿½off-siteï¿½. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Higgins and Ms. Tapanes regarding the applicantï¿½s continued commitment to providing support to the Underline. Ms. Tapanes Llahues noted the applicantï¿½s voluntarily proffer to contribute $600,000.00 to the ï¿½Friends of the Underlineï¿½ towards the Underline projectï¿½s deficit. Commissioner Higgins asked whether the projected road impact fees ($9 million) could be prioritized for use to fund neighboring metro-rail and metro-mover station repairs and improvements. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel reviewed the proposed language for an additional condition that would allow, to the maximum extent feasible, the use of the road impact fees generated by the project to be used for transit improvements within the vicinity of the project, consistent with Chapter 33E of the County Code. Commissioner Higgins requested staff to determine which transit improvements should be done by the developer instead of the County. Ms. Tapanes Llahues noted that the applicant accepted all the additional conditions as proffered by Commissioner Higgins. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel recounted the motion before the Board for consideration was as follows; ï¿½Motion to approve per staffï¿½s recommendation, with the additional condition by Mr. Kogon to condition them on different staff memorandum included in the kit which would include the most recent Transportation And Public Works Memorandum dated January 11, 2021; and the additional conditions as follows: ~\tLimited use of Southside Park for parking for fire station personnel, only in the event there was no other available parking to the satisfaction of the City of Miami Fire Chief; ~\tHardscaping and landscaping along 11th Street, to the maximum extent feasible; ~\tApplicantï¿½s voluntary contribution of $600,000.00 towards Underline improvements; ~\tThe use of road impact fees for transit improvements, to the maximum extent feasible. Commissioner Sosa announced that she received email correspondence pertaining to the foregoing application which was immediately forwarded to County Attorneyï¿½s Office in accordance with the Jennings Rule. Responding to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s request for clarification regarding the review process and which entity was responsible for conducting the application analyses; Ms. Claudia Diaz, Division Chief, DTPW; explained that the applicant was responsible for providing the traffic study and noted departmental staff reviewed the application.  She pointed out in this particular instance DTPW had reviewed the foregoing item and allowed the application to proceed to the second phase, the ASPR process, which would address and finalize staffï¿½s comments and conditions.  Ms. Diaz stated at this point in the process, the application review involved ensuring the proposed density was acceptable for the area. Commissioner Sosa asked whether the road impact fees generated by the project would to the County or City of Miami. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel responded that the impact fees discussed today would be paid to the County. Utilizing Ludlum Trail as an example, Commissioner Sosa asked if it was possible for District Commissioners to request impact fees generated in their specific commission districts to be redirected to pay for particular improvements in their respective districts. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that there were nine (9) impact fee benefit districts which were not specific to commission districts.  He noted it was within the Boardï¿½s discretion to urge that impact fees generated by a specific project, as was done with ï¿½American Dreamï¿½, be spent on improvements within the vicinity of the area impacted by the project. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Sosa and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding the intent of impact fees and the appropriate mechanism for ensuring impact fees generated by projects surrounding the Ludlum Trail were used to improve the trail. Commissioner Sosa pointed out the zoning process for projects around the Ludlum Trail had already been completed.  She stated while she did not object to the foregoing application, she was concerned about the use of the projectï¿½s impact fees to fund specified improvements limited to the area. Responding to Commissioner Sosaï¿½s question regarding the ï¿½Paseoï¿½ hours of operation, Ms. Tapanes Llahues clarified that the City of Miami was considering making Southside Park a pilot program to extend the hours of operation for municipal parks past the traditional dusk till dawn timeframe.  She pointed out that the program/hours had not yet been finalized and further action by the City of Miami Commission was needed. In light of the fact that the Paseo would remain open to the public, Commissioner Sosa asked about the security component of the project and questioned whether the County had any purview on the matter.  She pointed out the Ludlum Trail projectï¿½s approval was contingent on the projectï¿½s safety plan and funding. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained while the City of Miami was responsible for the operations of the park, the Board of County Commission (BCC/Board) maintained regulatory jurisdiction.  He noted it would be appropriate to include a special condition related to safety measures if the Board believed it was necessary for the use of the park within the RTZ. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Sosa and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel about the appropriate procedural process for addressing safety at the foregoing subject property versus other park locations. Commissioner Sosa suggested the applicant consider including a safety component to project. Commissioner Regalado echoed the concerns voiced by Commissioner Sosa regarding the use of the road impact fees generated by the project to fund specific improvements exclusive to the municipality.  She stated she would be supportive if the allocations could be used for improvements throughout entire RTZ and contended that it was dangerous to allocate impact fees during the zoning process.  Commissioner Regalado spoke about the disparity this type of allocation would create, particularly for Unincorporated Municipal Service Areas (UMSA), and indicated her intent to vote against the application if the impact fees were dedicated for use as proposed by Commissioner Higgins. Commissioner Regalado spoke about her efforts while serving as a Miami-Dade County Public Schools board member for the area, to secure additional seats for Brickell and the opposition put forth by the Downtown Development Authority. Vice Chairman Gilbert and Commissioners Monestime and McGhee echoed similar apprehension as expressed by Commissioners Sosa and Regalado regarding the allocation of impact fees generated by the project to fund transit improvements within the vicinity of the project. Commissioner Monestime referenced a previous discussion at a Sunshine meeting as to why impact fees could not be used to fund affordable housing projects and debated the process and ability to allocate impact fees for specific projects should be uniform and based on need. Commissioner Higgins commented on the poor conditions and broken infrastructure of the bus stops located in the area as well as the Brickell metro-mover and metro-rail stations.  She pointed out that similar conditions were imposed on developments around the Douglas Station where much of the land was County-owned and developers were required to improve the transit stations.  Commissioner Higgins contended the absence of County-owned land in the vicinity of the Brickell Station meant that the County would eventually have to use road impact fee funds to make the necessary improvements and explained the intent of her motion. Commissioner Regalado recognized the merits of the proposed application but reiterated she would not support the application based on her concerns about allocating impact fees during the zoning process and argued it would set a bad precedent.  She stressed that the zoning process was not the correct medium to address the issues raised by Commissioner Higgins and stated a greater conversation was needed to address the Boardï¿½s policy on impact fees. Vice Chairman Gilbert stated while he understood the intent of the motion proffered by Commissioner Higgins regarding allocation of the impact fees and he supported the item, he also concurred with Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s comments that the zoning process was not the appropriate mechanism to expedite transit improvements. Commissioner Sosa concurred with the comments made by Commissioner Regalado and reiterated she would not support the item if the impact fee allocation component remained as a special condition. Responding to Commissioner Hardemonï¿½s question as to whether impact fees could be used to maintain existing structures, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained they could be used for improvements necessary to serve increased development but not for regular maintenance. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel pointed out the additional condition proffered by Commissioner Higgins was still subject to analysis consistent with Chapter 33E of the County Code. Commissioner Hardemon spoke about the importance of specifying uses for the impact fees and concurred with his colleaguesï¿½ concerns about the zoning process not being the appropriate mechanism for allocating impact fees. Commissioner Monestime took issue with staffï¿½s selective approach regarding the use and application of impact fees. Commissioner Higgins acknowledged her colleagues concerns and agreed to withdraw her motion that the road impact fees be used for specific transit improvements in the area.  She also concurred that legislation was needed to address transit issues in RTZs. Responding to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request for guidance as to how to bring legislation before the Board to direct DTPW to perform the transit improvements at the Brickell Station, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated a separate item could be drafted to direct DTPW to examine the impact fees generated by the foregoing application and determine whether it was appropriate to spend such monies on improvements at the Brickell Station.  He noted this process would still adhere to Chapter 33E of the County Code which required all expenditures to be approved by the Board and Transportation Planning Organization (TPO). Commissioner Higgins requested the County Attorneyï¿½s Office to prepare the necessary legislation and stressed the importance of the improvements to the community and quality of life. Addressing Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s comment regarding staffï¿½s selective application of impact fees, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the conversations related to impact fees and affordable housing were limited to making certain types of developments, such as workforce housing, exempt or pay less in impact fees and noted this was completely different from the conversations today, as to where and how the fees could be spent.  He pointed out impact fees could be spent of specific transit capital improvements subject to identification through Chapter 33E of the County Code. Commissioner Martinez indicated his support for the item and pointed out that there was an ample availability of federal funds that could be used to facilitate the much needed repairs. Chairman Diaz thanked Commissioner Higgins for withdrawing the condition that the road impact fees be used for transit improvements in the projectï¿½s vicinity. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel restated the motion before the Board for consideration. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staff recommendation, with the additional condition that Mr. Kogon condition staff's recommendations on different staff memorandum included in the kit such as the most recent Transportation and Public Works memorandum dated January 11, 2021; and the additional conditions as follows: ~ Limited use of the Southside Park for fire station personnel parking, only in the event there is no other available parking to the satisfaction of the City of Miami Fire Chief; ~ Hardscaping and Landscaping along 11th Street to the maximum extent feasible; and ~ A voluntary $600,000.00 contribution by the applicant towards Underline improvements. The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-6-21. 4 210355 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000125  --  DISTRICT(S): 8  --  APPLICANT: CFF DEVELOPMENT GROUP, LLC  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS TO REZONE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY TO LEISURE CITY COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (LCUCD).

Chairman Diaz announced that Commissioner Souto had returned to the meeting (via Zoom). Mr. Simon Ferro, Avila Rodriguez Hernandez Mena & Ferri LLP, 2525 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, CFF Development Group, LLC; and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation briefly reviewed the application request highlighting the subject propertyï¿½s location and historic use, neighboring properties and uses, current zoning designations for the subject property and the proximity of the subject property to existing bus stations. Mr. Ferro advised the Board members of the applicantï¿½s intent to proceed with the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process and spoke about the challenges associated with developing the property.  He reported the applicant had previously submitted a proffered covenant which restricted the projectï¿½s building height to six (6) stories and noted the covenant was revised today (2/18) to further limit the building height along 162nd Avenue to four (4) stories. Mr. Ferro spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to engage the community and acknowledged the residentsï¿½ concerns regarding increased traffic congestion, particularly along 162nd Avenue and US 1. He proceeded to review the subject propertyï¿½s location in relation to the Harriet Tubman Highway and argued the proposed development would have minimal to no impact along 162nd Avenue since there were several alternative routes to access/exit the proposed development. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board: Ms. Lucia Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ and presented 21 letters of opposition towards the item, noting another 76 letters were emailed.  She stated while the applicant scheduled two Zoom meetings with the residents nothing had been resolved and the community was left with the impression that the item would be deferred.  Mr. Echauri noted the community was adamantly opposed to the application and spoke about the negative impact the proposed development would have on the communityï¿½s quality of life. Mr. Nicholas Dï¿½Ambrosia, member of ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½27850 SW 154th Court, Miami FL, stated the application was not compatible with the neighborhood and voiced his opposition to the item.  He noted the applicant contacted the residents yesterday (2/17) to advise that the application would be deferred and requested the Board defer the item to allow the residents to continue to meet with the applicant regarding their concerns. Mr. Ernesto Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the application and echoed the comments made by previous speakers regarding the applicantï¿½s representation that the item would be deferred. Ms. Vanessa Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the application and noted that the residents have requested additional information from the applicant.  She confirmed the applicantï¿½s representation to the community that the item would be deferred and requested the Board do so to allow the residents to continue to meet with the applicant. Mr. Efrain Nunez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Homestead FL, reported the applicant had met with neighbors on two occasions to discuss the item and noted at the most recent meeting held on February 16, 2021, residents requested the applicant provide a Massing Study, site plan, cross-sectional renderings depicting the proposed height and allowable set-backs in relation to the surrounding neighborhood.  He stated he was personally contacted by the applicantï¿½s legal counsel on February 17, 2021 advising of their intent to request a deferral at todayï¿½s (2/18) meeting which he promptly communicated to all interested/concerned neighbors.  Mr. Nunez indicated that he was contacted a second time by the applicantï¿½s legal counsel to notify him of the applicantï¿½s intent to proceed with the item at todayï¿½s (2/18) zoning meeting and requested the Board members defer the item until the June 2021 zoning meeting since he was unable to notify residents of the last minute change.  He pointed out many of the residents opposing the item were unable to attend todayï¿½s meeting because of the applicantï¿½s prior representation that the item would be deferred and reiterated his request for the item to be deferred to allow the residents and opportunity to appear before the Board. Mr. James Davison, 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami FL, appeared in opposition of the item and requested the item be deferred. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. In response to comments made by the previous speakers, Mr. Ferro clarified that the applicant never agreed to supply a site plan since none was available.  He noted that the applicant was in the process of designing the development to mitigate impact and pointed out that there were no residential units located on the adjoining property.  Mr. Ferro reviewed the surrounding areas and reported that the traffic consultant determined the proposed development would not impact the residential areas.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to negotiate with the community to address their concerns, noting the residents were requesting the entire development be limited to four (4) stories. Mr. Ferro argued the subject property needed more flexibility for proper development and reviewed the existing allowable density (up to 90 units per acre) available under the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP).  He pointed out if the applicantï¿½s request to rezone the subject property to Leisure City Community Urban Center District (LCUCD), the development could be developed up to 12 stories in height and 90 units per acre.  Mr. Ferro reiterated the proffered covenant restricted the building heights for the proposed development to six (6) stories, with further restriction for buildings along 162nd Avenue to four (4) stories in response to the residentsï¿½ traffic concerns.  Mr. Ferro noted while the applicant had reduced the density, height and impacts to the community; more flexibility was needed for the development to be successful. Addressing Mr. Ferroï¿½s comments about the applicant voluntarily contacting the neighbors regarding the proposed development, Vice Chairman Gilbert pointed out that it was in fact the applicantï¿½s responsibility to do so and stated that he understood the residentï¿½s apprehension about the application based on the lack of specificity and details provided to them. Commissioner Cohen Higgins thanked the residents for appearing today and expressing their concerns regarding the application.  She stated that she too had shared concerns about the item, particularly the applicantï¿½s representation that the subject property did not abut any residential properties.  Commissioner Cohen Higgins cited a departmental memo which identified multi-family low density properties to the north, single-family residences/low density residential properties to the south and low density residential properties to the west. Commissioner Cohen Higgins reasoned the applicantï¿½s request to build a six (6) story development in an area otherwise devoid of any other high rise buildings may be realized if the applicant took the time to really engage the residents and incorporate their input into the projectï¿½s design.  She moved to defer the foregoing application and stated while she appreciated the fact that the applicant had two Zoom meetings, she believed the applicant should meet with the residents in person so that both parties could negotiate a meaningful compromise. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Mr. Ferro regarding an appropriate deferral period to allow the applicant to meet with the residents at the subject location. Mr. Ferro stated once the Board of County Commission (Board) and residents understood that the site plan would not be ready in time for a meeting, the applicant was prepared to meet with the residents within the next 30 days. Commissioner Cohen Higgins cautioned the applicant to honor representations made to the residents and suggested the item be deferred for 60 days to allow the applicant sufficient time to return to the residents with more specific plans for the proposed development in the absence of a site plan. Hearing no questions or comments the Board proceeded to vote to defer the foregoing application to the April 21, 2021 zoning meeting. 5 210356 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000137  --  DISTRICT(S) 4  --  APPLICANT: STAR HOLDINGS MANAGEMENT LLC & NESS REALTY, LLC -- SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS TO AMEND THE OJUS URBAN AREA DISTRICT (''OUAD'') STREET TYPE PLAN.  --  LOCATION: 2600 & 2630 NE 203RD STREET MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-7-21 Mover: Sally A.

Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Star Holdings Management LLC, and explained the application was a technical request to amend the street type plan.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.  Ms. Adriana Guerrero, 7920 SW 58th Street, Miami FL 2.  Mr. Carlos Guerrero, no address provided 3.  Ms. Suris Josefa Raimundez, 7900 SW 58th Street, Miami FL 4.  Ms. Raquel Maria Raimundez, 7801 SW 66th Street, Miami FL The following persons appeared in support of the foregoing item: 1.  Mr. Kevin Grace, Executive Director of the Miami Learning Experience School (MLES), 9443 SW 227th Lane, Miami FL, clarified the intent of the item was not to seek a drastic increase in the schoolï¿½s student capacity but rather expand the space to better serve the students.  He noted the school served the special needs population of the community and spoke about the schoolï¿½s efforts to be a good neighbor.  Mr. Grace pointed out that the school hosted a meeting two months ago for residents to tour the facility and learn more about the program; and reported only one individual attended the meeting. 2.  Mr. Terry Blumer, Vice Chairman of the Board for the Miami Learning Experience School (MLES), 60 Solano Prado, Coral Gables FL, pointed out that the entrance to the school property was located opposite train tracks with no homes in the area.  He added that the subject property proposed for development would not include an access point to the school and noted the existing entrance would remain in place. Mr. Blumer argued that the school and proposed development was compatible with the neighborhood since there were already some homes situated on half acre lots and two-story homes in the area.  He spoke about the importance and impact of the school on the community and stressed that the school not only serviced its enrolled students and families, but it also provided opportunities for students from other schools throughout the County to earn community service hours and host public events. 3.   Mr. Paul Arango, Chairman of the Board of the Miami Learning Experience School (MLES), 10645 Lakeside Drive, Coral Gables FL, appeared in support of the item and provided a brief history of the school.  He noted the school was founded almost 50 years ago and had been located in the area for the past 25 years.  Mr. Arango stated notable figures such as Former United States Senator Claude Pepper and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen supported the schoolï¿½s mission and mentioned Commissioner Regalado had toured the school in her former capacity on the Miami-Dade County Public School Board.  Mr. Arango explained the intent of the item was to improve the experience for the schoolï¿½s population and not to expand the size of the program. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Alejandro Arias, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, the Miami Learning Experience School and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation provided a brief background of the school and reviewed the applicantï¿½s request highlighting: ~\tThe schoolï¿½s Core Belief ~\tProposed School Addition and Estate Lot ~\tApplication Requests ~\tCurrent Zoning ~\tProposed Site Plan ~\tProposed Elevations ~\tView of Campus Entrance (facing East) including renderings of the proposed development ~\tZoning Requests ~\tStaff Recommendation ï¿½ Approval Mr. Arias advised the Board members that the applicant hosted meetings with the neighbors to discuss the variance requests and reported prior to todayï¿½s (3/17) meeting, there had been no objections voiced or expressed by the community.  He pointed out that the application received 83 letters of support which were submitted to the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB) in December 2020. Mr. Arias concluded his presentation and reiterated the foregoing application would not result in the intensification of the site beyond the scale of the surrounding area.  He urged the Board to approve the item per staffï¿½s recommendation; and noted the item would allow MLES to continue its mission to provide additional educational options to the developmentally disabled members of the community. Commissioner Regalado acknowledged and thanked the neighbors for appearing before the Board regarding their concerns.  She spoke of her visit to the facility in her former capacity as a Miami-Dade County Public School Board member and stressed the importance of the services provided and the life skills taught by the school to the neurodivergent population. Commissioner Regalado noted the Board of County Commission (BCC/Board) recently approved legislation pertaining to therapeutic recreation and inclusion for neurodivergent adults at the Countyï¿½s parks and transit plans.  She contended MLES should not be compared to a traditional high school and pointed out the capacity increase would not bring additional traffic congestion to the area because the student body doesnï¿½t drive. Commissioner Regalado argued the Coronavirus 2019 Disease (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the need for alternative solutions for the neurodivergent population and pointed out the residential training offered at MLES provided a pathway to independence and self-sufficiency for neurodivergent children and young adults.   She briefly spoke about the challenges neurodivergent children encounter in learning new tasks and functions and stressed the importance of continuity of service in the same location.  She reiterated the slight increase in capacity would not impact traffic in the neighborhood and stated she believed the proposed expansion was thoughtful and compatible with the surrounding area. Commissioner Regalado stated her only concern was related to the landscaping plans and suggested the applicant consider increasing the landscaping coverage to provide additional protection and privacy to the neighbors.  She encouraged the applicant to use other types of plants aside from palm trees to provide more buffering. Commissioner Heyman indicated her support for the foregoing application and concurred with Commissioner Regalado regarding the need for additional landscape buffering. Mr. Arias advised the Board members that the applicant was amenable to modifying the landscaping plan to provide additional protection and buffering. Responding to Commissioner Heymanï¿½s request for clarification, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed that the item could be approved to include a landscaping condition. Commissioner Heyman stated she would like the landscaping to provide buffering in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. Commissioner Sosa agreed that it was time attention was paid to the needs of the neurodivergent population and voiced her support for the item.  She also concurred that the landscaping plan needed to be improved and recommended the applicant utilize native non-invasive trees. Commissioner Souto indicated his support for the item and agreed that there was a need for skills and developmental training for neurodivergent children to ensure they learn to lead self-sufficient lives.  He echoed the comments made by his colleagues Commissioners Regalado, Heyman and Sosa; regarding the use of tropical native landscaping in lieu of palm tree and spoke about the plans to make Tropical Park a therapeutic recreation point for the neurodivergent population. Commissioner Regalado moved to approve the application per staff recommendation; and amend to include the additional landscaping condition that native trees and plants be used to provide additional buffering and protection to the neighbors.

Mr. Kenneth Merker, 7707 Camino Real, Miami FL There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Tucker Gibbs appeared on behalf of the Kings Creek Village Association, owners of the property located immediately south of the subject applicantï¿½s property, and urged the Board of County Commission (Board/BCC) to deny the foregoing application. Mr. Gibbs referenced a prior application filed by the same applicant, JDP Equities, LLC, which was previously denied by the Board in the Spring of 2019 and argued the foregoing application sought to develop an even larger project.  He stated that his clients maintained their initial objections to the proposed application and had refused to meet with the developer despite the applicantï¿½s invitation.  Mr. Gibbs argued the Board has previously denied a similar project and noted rezoning requests must be consistent with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) and satisfy the Countyï¿½s zoning code requirements; which he contended was not the case with the foregoing application. Mr. Gibbs read into the record elements of the foregoing application and listed the reasons the Board should deny the application and uphold the covenant. Ms. Melissa Tapanes Llahues, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin + Tapanes Zoning Land Use and Environmental Law, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, JDP Equities, LLC; and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation provided a brief review of the foregoing application highlighting: ~\tThe subject propertyï¿½s location, size and zoning history ~\tRequests ~\tProperty ~\tOutdated structures frozen in time ï¿½ Occupancy, comparables and Ad Valorem Taxes ~\tSurrounding neighborhood ï¿½ Dadeland Mall circa 1962 vs present day ~\tCDMP Neighborhood Compatibility ~\tSMART Plan Kendall Corridor ~\tTransit Map ~\tBus Route 87 ~\tProtests ~\tStatement made by Mr. Gibbs at November 13, 2018 Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB) Commissioner Regalado recognized and thanked the neighbors for appearing before the Board regarding their concern.  She stated while she acknowledged the intent of the covenant, much in the County has since changed and she noted the proposed application was well within the scope of the Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ).  Commissioner Regalado pointed out that the residents themselves recognized that the commercial property was in need of improvements.  She expressed her concerns regarding Mr. Gibbs refusal to meet with the applicant and stated both parties needed to meet to consider and discuss alternative options.  Commissioner Regalado contended that the RTZ was only going to continue to expand and stated while she understood the concerns voiced by the residents she believed a greater dialogue was needed between both parties. Chairman Diaz stated that the Board of County Commission (Board/BCC) was required to make a decision based on the information presented despite the residentï¿½s refusal to meet with the applicant. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staff recommendation. Commissioner Sosa requested the landscaping in the area be improved and beautified. Commissioner Regalado agreed that the area needed more buffering and green space. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), explained the foregoing application sought to rezone the subject property and similar to a RTZ, the next step involved an administrative site plan approval process.  He noted the applicant was required to satisfy the County Code for Mixed-use Corridor District (MCD) which provide for enhanced aesthetics, landscaping and buffering.  Mr. Kogon clarified that while staff was supportive of the rezoning of the property the applicant was still required to comply with the administrative site plan review and approval. Commissioner Regalado requested the applicant include additional buffering and landscaping as well as include green space for the community.  She reiterated the applicant was in-line with the RTZ and spoke about the Countyï¿½s prioritization of RTZs.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board of County Commissioners (Board) in opposition of the item: 1.   \tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami, Florida, noted the previous owner entered into a covenant in 2018 which limited development to 29 single family homes on the subject site.  She reported the property was sold shortly thereafter to the current owner with the 30 year covenant in place and requested the Board of County Commissioners (Board) deny the application. 2.   \tMr. Harvey Anglin, 28223 SW 158th Court, Miami, Florida, argued the proposed development would only worsen the already poor traffic conditions in the area. 3.   \tMs. Lucia Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami, Florida, requested the Board respect the existing covenant and deny the foregoing application. 4.   \tMr. Ernesto Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami,  Florida 5.   \tMr. Richard Blake, 15955 SW 288th Street, Miami,  Florida 6.   \tMs. Melana Davison, 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami, Florida, spoke about the detrimental impact the proposed development would have on her orchid nursery and implored the Board to deny the application. 7.   \tMs. Rachel Mullin (phonetic), 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami, Florida 8.   \tMr. James Davison, 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami,  Florida 9.   \tMr. Nicholas Dï¿½Ambrosia, 27850 SW 154th Court, Miami, Florida 10.   \tMr. Jorge Sosa, 28000 SW 157th Avenue, Miami,  Florida 11.   \tMr. Hendrik Schorel, 28100 SW 157th Avenue, Miami,  Florida 12.   \tMr. Efrain Nunez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Homestead, Florida, referenced his professional experience in public policy and planning and argued the proposed application was incompatible with the surrounding community.  He provided a brief history of the subject property and urged the Board to consider the increasing amount of development occurring in the area and the impact on the community. 13.   \tDr. Martin Motes, 25000 SW 162nd Avenue, Miami, Florida, member of the Dade County Agricultural Practices Advisory Board, argued the foregoing application was premature given the fact that it was based on the Countyï¿½s plans to build a new bus stop on 288th Street.  He pointed out the application lacked input from the agricultural community and the Miami-Dade County Public School Board and requested the Board deny the item. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced there was one (1) speaker registered to speak virtually using Zoom communications technology. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel explained the speaker appearing via Zoom was granted reasonable accommodations to appear virtually prior to the itemï¿½s deferral at the March 17, 2021 Zoning meeting and noted the department has since established a new practice for speakers requesting reasonable accommodations. Deputy Clerk Kerry Khunjar Breakenridge re-administered the witness oath. 14.   \tMs. Tania Mora, 16220 SW 285th Street, Miami, Florida, argued the foregoing application was incompatible with the community and existing covenant. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, South Dixie 29, LLC et al; and provided a brief history of the foregoing application and reviewed the applicantï¿½s request.  He explained the existing covenant applied to a portion of the property and argued the covenant no longer aligned with the Countyï¿½s policy to develop and increase density along transit oriented corridors. Mr. Vazquez spoke about the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process and the newly proffered Declaration of Restrictions (DOR).  He noted the new DOR would limit the height and density of the project and reported the proposed multi-family development would be restricted to four (4) stories, well below the maximum permitted height (12 stories); with a density of 35 units per acre, as opposed to the maximum density allowed of 90 units per acre for properties located within a quarter mile of the Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) corridor.  Mr. Vazquez indicated the applicant anticipated the final project plans would produce 20 units per acre. Mr. Vazquez with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation identified the location of the closest existing bus stop in relation to the subject property and pointed out the proximity of the subject site to the Harriet Tubman Highway and the South Dade Busway.  He briefly summarized staffï¿½s findings and recommendations pursuant to the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) and Zoning analyses and reasoned that the application was consistent with the Countyï¿½s SMART plan and compatible with the surrounding area. Mr. Vazquez spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to meet with the community and noted the newly proffered DOR was the applicantï¿½s attempt to compromise and resolve the residentsï¿½ concerns.  He contended a fully developed busway was critical to securing much needed federal funding to accomplish the Countyï¿½s transit expansion plans and argued developing single family homes along the busway was not viable.  Mr. Vazquez submitted for the record letters of support from the Builders Association of South Florida (BASF) and the Latin Builders Association (LBA) and requested the Board approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated while the foregoing application was consistent with the Boardï¿½s SMART plan policy for development along transit oriented corridors; and staff recommended approval, she was concerned about the existing covenant; which she pointed out was an agreement entered into after the creation of the SMART plan.  She contended the foregoing application was incompatible with the surrounding area and requested the applicant consider a reduction in density. Commissioner Hardemon concurred with the comments made by Commissioner Cohen Higgins and pointed out that the owner of the subject property purchased the land with knowledge of the existing covenant. Commissioner Heyman echoed the concerns voiced by Commissioner Cohen Higgins and stated she could not support the application as presented. Commissioner Gilbert III indicated that, while he was a strong advocate for increasing density along transit oriented corridors, he did not believe the foregoing application should petition for an increase in density under the pretext of the Countyï¿½s SMART plan policy because the applicant purchased the property with full knowledge of the existence of the covenant.  He also noted that he did not support the removal of the covenant. Commissioner Regalado concurred with the comments made by Commissioner Gilbert III and commented the applicant may have other options available to address and resolve the residentsï¿½ concerns and/or to be released from the covenant. Mr. Vazquez pointed out that the application had been pending since 2019 and was deferred twice to allow the applicant to meet with the residents regarding their concerns.  He argued the covenant applied to only a portion of the subject property and reviewed elements of the applicantï¿½s request.  Mr. Vazquez acknowledged the Boardï¿½s concerns regarding the proposed developmentï¿½s density and stated that the applicant was prepared to limit the building height to three (3) stories. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated while she appreciated the applicantï¿½s offer to reduce the buildingï¿½s height, she did not believe a height reduction was sufficient to address and resolve the residentsï¿½ concerns; and asked the applicant to meet with the community to discuss the possibility of a density reduction in order to be able to make the transition more natural. Mr. Vazquez advised the Board members that the residents were resistant to compromise and were adamant on the project being limited to single family homes.  He noted the shade study conducted by the applicant revealed that the nursery was not at risk and argued that the repeated deferrals gave the applicant the impression that the Board was considering the merits of the application based on the subject propertyï¿½s location, the Countyï¿½s SMART Plan policy, and the residentsï¿½ concerns despite the existence of the covenant. Chairman Diaz noted that Commissioner Cohen Higgins, the District Commissioner, was attempting to provide the applicant an opportunity to work with the community while protecting her constituents and inquired whether the applicant was amenable to continuing discussions with the residents. Mr. Vazquez agreed to continue meeting with the residents. Commissioner Cohen Higgins offered to attend the meetings to facilitate discussions, if needed. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel cautioned Commissioner Cohen Higgins about attending the meetings due to the Jennings Rule. Commissioner Gilbert III noted the Jennings Rule did not exclude commissioners from attending community meetings regarding zoning matters.  He clarified the rule simply required full disclosure about attendance and a statement that an unbiased decision could be reached. Chairman Diaz concurred that Board members should be cautious about attending community meetings to avoid issues. Commissioner Cohen Higgins moved to defer the foregoing application for 30 days to allow the applicant to meet with the residents for the last time in an attempt to reach a consensus on issues of concern. Responding to Commissioner Heymanï¿½s question regarding the need for a public hearing at the next zoning meeting, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified there was no need for the Board to reopen the public hearing. He explained the Board could limit comments to allow for an update from the applicant and a representative from the community regarding the outcome of the community meeting. There being no other comments or objections, the Board by motion duly made, seconded and carried, deferred the foregoing item to May 19, 2021, Zoning meeting. 3/17/2021 Deferred by the Zoning Board CURRENT ITEMS 1 210905 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2019000151  --  DISTRICT(S): 8   --  APPLICANT: U-HAUL COMPANY OF FLORIDA   --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING APPROVAL TO PERMIT SELF-STORAGE FACILITY ON THE SUBJECT SITE.  --  LOCATION: LYING NORTH OF SW 304 STREET AND SOUTHEAST OF US-1, AKA 30215 S.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing; and there being no one registered or appearing to speak, closed the public hearing. Mr. Fred Andara (phonetic), 10829 NW 7th Street, Miami, Florida, briefly reviewed the intent of the foregoing item and noted staff recommended approval with conditions. Mr. Sergio Bertot, property owner, 6460 SW 34th Street, Miami, Florida, noted his request sought a district boundary change from Single Family Residential District (RU-1) to Industrial Light Manufacturing District (IU-1) along with other non-use variances related to the required building setbacks and buffers. Commissioner Regalado requested clarification from the applicant regarding the type of warehouse planned for the subject site.  She voiced her concerns regarding the applicantï¿½s request to waive the buffer requirements and asked whether there were any residential developments located adjacent to or at the rear of the subject property. Mr. Andara stated the proposed development would be limited to office and warehouse uses. Mr. Kogon explained the area was comprised of pockets of both residential and industrial development with some residential units surrounding the subject property.  He stated staff found the landscaping to be appropriate given the width of the subject property and pointed out the location of the building to the east of the subject site provided adequate natural buffering.  Mr. Kogon referenced a previous similar application which was approved by the Board of County Commissioners (Board/BCC) and reported staff found the application to be compatible with the transitional nature of the neighborhood. In light of the fact that there were no objectors to the item and staffï¿½s recommendations, Commissioner Regalado indicated her support for the application. Hearing no questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board: 1.   \t Ms. Heather Pernas, 350 SW 125th Avenue, Miami Florida, spoke in opposition of the item. Chairman Diaz requested speakers limit their comments to one minute moving forward. The following speakers appeared in support of the item: 1.   \tMr. Maxim Torres (phonetic), student, expounded the benefits of expanding the school to include a dedicated athletic facility. 2.   \tMr. Isiah Fuller (phonetic), student, echoed the comments made by fellow student, Mr. Torres and spoke about his future academic and career goals of becoming a sports agent. 4.   \tFather Willie Garcia-Tunon, President of Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, 12725 SW 6th Street, Miami, Florida, thanked the Board of County Commissioners (BCC/Board) for their continued support of the school and noted the new chapel was scheduled to be completed in October 2021.  He reassured the Board members that their parking concerns had been addressed and noted the proposed athletic facility was a direct response to recently adopted State Legislature, the Zachary Martin Act, intended to protect high school student athletics against heat strokes. Hearing no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Ben Fernandez, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin & Tapanes, 200 S. Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 300, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, Inc.  He noted the tremendous support for the application and pointed out the school had been located on the subject site for over 40 years.  Mr. Fernandez reassured the Board members that the applicant was not seeking to increase student enrollment and pointed out the proposed athletic facility was part of the schoolï¿½s master plan and would complete the campus.  He proceeded to publish a PowerPoint presentation, which highlighted the new surface parking area, netting for the baseball field, and how the design of the proposed facility would serve as a natural buffer for the football field and the surrounding area. Responding to Commissioner Hardemonï¿½s request for more information regarding the schoolï¿½s composition and financial aid offers, Father Garcia-Tunon noted while the Belen Jesuit Preparatory School had been providing educational services for 166 years, it began serving the Miami community in 1961.  He explained the all-boys Catholic school currently enrolled 1325 students and provided over $1.5 million in financial assistance annually. Father Garcia-Tunon estimated over 35 percent of the student body received financial aid, which was awarded based on need and funded by donations and alumni. Father Garcia-Tunon noted the school had over 8000 alumni and serviced 6th grade through 12th grade. Chairman Diaz voiced his support for the application and requested the applicant adhere to the landscaping buffering plan included in the application. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staff recommendation. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number #Z-13-21. 4 210908 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000096  --  DISTRICT(S): 12   --  APPLICANT: VALGIR CORP  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING TO PERMIT A CEMETERY ON A PARCEL OF LAND WITH LESS LOT AREA THAN REQUIRED BY CODE.

Commissioner Heyman inquired about the expansion of the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) to facilitate the cemeteryï¿½s growth. Mr. Kogon pointed out the Countyï¿½s Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) Land Use Element provided for expansion of the UDB based on specific uses and the fact that the cemetery was not new. Commissioner Heyman voiced her support for the item. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and requested speakers limit their comments to one (1) minute. The following individuals appeared before the Board of County Commissioners (Board) in opposition of the item: 1.   \tMs. Claudia Klevan, 7520 SW 72nd Court, Miami, Florida, argued the proposed development was incompatible with the neighborhood and noted many of the elderly residents were unable to attend todayï¿½s (04/21) meeting or appear using the Zoom communications technology to voice their opposition to the item.  She reported there was a petition with 164 signatures opposing the item. 2.   \tMr. Colin Klevan, 7520 SW 72nd Court, Miami, Florida, voiced his concerns regarding the environmental impact of the proposed development noting the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to the Trinity Pines Nature Preserve. 3.   \tMs. Monica Chainani, 7260 SW 76th Street, Miami, Florida, echoed the comments made by Ms. Klevan. 4.   \tMs. Cristina Miranda Gilson, 7700 SW 72nd Court, Miami, Florida, requested the Board deny the foregoing application and pointed out that Century Homebuilders Group, LLC owned the subject property and not Theresa Provisero, as noted in the application. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 3300, Miami, Florida, explained the application was filed under the previous ownerï¿½s name (Theresa Provisero), and noted the zoning application disclosed Century Homebuilders Group, LLCï¿½s contract to purchase the property. Mr. Mayol provided a brief review of the application and noted the subject property was situated on a major arterial roadway (SW 72nd Avenue).  He summarized staffï¿½s recommendations and requested the Boardï¿½s approval to withdraw requests 1 through 4 and proceed with requests 5 through 9. In response to Chairman Diazï¿½s request for clarification regarding the applicantï¿½s request to withdraw requests 1 through 4, Mr. Kogon explained there were two (2) options available to the applicant to achieve the applicantï¿½s desired goals.  He noted the first option entailed rezoning the property from One-Acre Estate Single Family Residential District (EU-1) to Estate Modified District (EU-M) with certain variances, while the second option included requesting certain variances of lot size under the current EU-1 provision.  Mr. Kogon clarified that staff opposed the rezoning of the property from EU-1 to EU-M (requests 1 through 4) but supportive of requests 5 through 9, which involved non-use variance requests for the existing zoning designation. Mr. Kogon advised the Board members that the applicant was now requesting the Boardï¿½s approval to withdraw requests 1 through 4, which staff originally recommended the Board to deny (see staffï¿½s recommendation).  He further explained if the Board chose to approve requests 1 through 4 and deny requests 5 through 9, the end result would be the same as if the Board denied requests 1 through 4 but approved requests 5 through 9. Mr. Mayol published a PowerPoint presentation highlighting: ~\tLocation and size ~\tProximity to Downtown Kendall ~\tComprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) Land Use Map ~\tZoning classification ~\tExisting conditions at the property ~\tProposed design ï¿½ accessed only along SW 72nd Avenue with a private cul-de-sac ~\tRenderings of proposed development ~\tDepartment reviews ~\tEstimated impact fees ~\tTraffic analysis conducted by County ~\tSchool Board Review ~\tRoadway improvements ~\tPrevailing lot sizes in the neighborhood ~\tMost recent application approvals ~\tNeighborhood support Mr. Mayol requested the Board approve the applicantï¿½s request to withdraw requests 1 through 4 and approve requests 5 through 9 per staffï¿½s recommendation. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Mayol regarding the prevalence and location of similarly developed communities with single access entry points in the form of ï¿½cul-de-sacs.ï¿½ Commissioner Regalado commended and recognized the benefits of the single access point but voiced concerns regarding the number of recorded protests given the size of the community. Mr. Mayol pointed out that a large number of the recorded protesters resided outside the area and contended they may have been given incorrect information about the application. Responding to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s question about the applicantï¿½s plans to provide landscaping buffers, Mr. Mayol explained that the applicant was amenable to any additional landscaping requirements imposed by the Board and noted the home design included ï¿½deepï¿½ yards. Mr. Kogon noted the applicant was only requesting a non-use variance of the allowable setbacks for the front on the properties and pointed out the proposed development would remain consistent with other EU-1 zoned parcels with regards to rear and side setbacks.  He recommended, in the event the Board wished to impose additional buffering requirements, the applicant be required to install six (6) feet high hedges with shade trees spaced on average at 25 feet along the rear property line. Chairman Diaz indicated his intent to follow the District Commissionerï¿½s lead and stated he believed the foregoing application was a direct result of ï¿½holding the line.ï¿½ Commissioner Regalado commented that while she recognized the residentsï¿½ concerns, she believed the single access point and additional landscape buffering requirement should resolve the communityï¿½s issues with the application. In response to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s inquiry about the price points for the homes in the proposed development, Mr. Sergio Pino, President and Founder of Century Homebuilders Group, LLC, reported the single story homes would start at $1.5 million with the two (2) story models starting at $2 million.  He pointed out that there was a home located opposite the subject site currently listed for $900,000 and stated he anticipated the proposed development would increase property values in the neighborhood.  Mr. Pino noted that he personally met with the three (3) closest neighbors and reported they remained supportive of the project. Commissioner Regalado recognized the merits of the application and requested the buffering requirements be included as a condition of the itemï¿½s approval.  She also requested the applicant refrain from using palm trees. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation, with the additional condition of requiring additional landscape buffering, consisting of six (6) feet high hedges with shade trees, not to include palm trees, spaced on average at 25 feet along the west perimeter of Lots 1 and 4, and the south perimeter of Lots 4, 5 and 6, surrounding the development adjacent to the existing properties.

Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 3300, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, 8290 Partners, LLC; and reassured the Board members that there was no covenant associated with the subject property.

Mr. Mayol estimated the applicant hosted between five (5) to six (6) virtual meetings utilizing Zoom communications technology and had numerous other conversations with individual residents.  He stated the Zoom meetings were attended by approximately 15 to 16 individuals and advised the meetings were advertised with the help of Mr. Aluko through the group ï¿½Preserve Historic Killian.ï¿½ Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ question as to the number of townhomes planned for the community, Mr. Mayol explained the proposed development would consist of 32 townhomes and 22 single family homes. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Mr. Mayol regarding the status of the traffic mitigation report and the applicantï¿½s willingness to comply with the recommendations of the final report. Mr. Mayol pointed out the proffered Declaration of Restrictions required the applicant to complete the traffic analysis for review and approval by staff and to take action per staffï¿½s recommendations.  He stated that he anticipated the final report would be completed within the next five (5) months. Mr. Mayol pointed out that the applicant had committed to spending an estimated $419,000 in roadway impact fees and requested staff consider offsetting this cost with a credit against the project impact fees to keep the funds in the community.  He reiterated the applicantï¿½s commitment to work with the County Attorneyï¿½s Office and staff to finalize the plans. Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ request for clarification regarding the existence of a covenant, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel confirmed that there was no record of a covenant attached to the subject property. Commissioner Cohen Higgins inquired about the maximum number of units that could be built under the current designation. Mr. Kogon explained the subject property was located within the first quarter mile within the Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ); and as such, pursuant to the SMART plan for intensification, up to 60 units per acres was allowed.  He pointed out the density under the SMART plan required a zoning hearing and approval by the Board.  Mr. Kogon noted the applicantï¿½s proposed plan would develop approximately 5.4 units per acre or eight percent (8%) of the allowable maximum. Commissioner Cohen Higgins noted the application was consistent with the Countyï¿½s SMART plan for development along transit oriented corridors and acknowledged the applicantï¿½s efforts to resolve the residentsï¿½ concerns regarding density.  She indicated her support for the item and reiterated there was currently no covenant attached to the subject property. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation, with the acceptance of the covenant proffered today (4/21). The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number #Z-16-21.

He advised the Board members that he was also accompanied by Mr. Mario Martinez, Ms. Davina Bean, and Mr. Orismel Alvarez, representatives for the company.

He argued adding too much density would be a disservice to the neighborhood and highlighted the unique nature of the subject property given the communityï¿½s diverse zoning designations. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing, and there being no one registered or appearing to speak, closed the public hearing. Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ questions about the height and design of the proposed building, Mr. Avino briefly reviewed the proposed site plan, noting the building would be three (3) stories in height and provide self-storage facilities.  He explained the three (3) story building would be located closest to US-1 with ï¿½at-gradeï¿½ covered parking for commercial vehicles to the rear of the subject property abutting the residential development. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated that while she acknowledged staffï¿½s recommendation to deny the application without prejudice based on insufficient density, she did not believe all parcels located along transit-oriented corridors mandated large densities; therefore, she moved to approve the foregoing application with standard conditions tying the approval to the proffered site plan. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application as amended.

Bluebird Lane, Homestead, Florida 11. \tMs. Paola Catano, (with the aid of an interpreter) 454 SE 32nd Avenue, Homestead, Florida There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Ferro briefly revisited the letter of support read into the record by Mr. Pharo; and noted in addition to the issues identified by Mr. Pharo, the applicant had addressed the residentsï¿½ concerns about the promotion of visual and performing arts through the monetary contribution to the two (2) schools listed earlier.  He pointed out that the residentsï¿½ landscaping and connectivity concerns were also addressed and resolved. Mr. Ferro explained there were two (2) other concerns raised by the residents which were not addressed in the covenant, specifically, the proposed developmentï¿½s security plans, which would be managed by the management company, and a commitment that the applicant create jobs for local residents, which was unenforceable since there was currently no mechanism in place for the applicant to hire local residents. Commissioner Cohen Higgins indicated her support for the application and acknowledged the 356 petitions submitted in support of the item.  She reiterated the importance of resident input in the zoning process and recognized the applicantï¿½s efforts to address the communityï¿½s concerns as evidenced by the proffered covenant, particularly the voluntary monetary donations to the schools. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, per staffï¿½s recommendation. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-18-21. 2/18/2021 Deferred by the Zoning Board 4/21/2021 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1C 210618 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2021000004  --  DISTRICT(S): 8  --  APPLICANT: SOUTH DIXIE 29, LLC, & WILLIAM WESLEY BASS, JR.

Heyman Vote: 7 - 0 Absent: Higgins Excused: Gilbert, III , Monestime , Hardemon , Sosa , McGhee REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 248 protests and no waivers filed. Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, South Dixie 29, LLC et al., and noted the foregoing application was deferred from the April 21, 2021, zoning meeting to allow the applicant to meet with the residents for the last time in an attempt to reach a consensus on issues of concern.  He argued that the existing covenant was proffered to the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB) and not the Board of County Commissioners (Board), as stated by several speakers at the last (4/21) Zoning meeting and contended CZABs policies do not necessarily align with the Boardï¿½s policies. Mr. Vazquez, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, provided a brief history of the foregoing application highlighting: ~\tExcerpt from the passage of Ordinance No. 19-07; ~\tExcerpt from staff recommendation of previous rezoning application to Estate Density Residential (EU-M); ~\tPoints specific to the subject property; and ~\tTimeline of negotiations with neighbors - proposals made by developer and response by neighbors. Mr. Vazquez maintained that the subject property was rezoned prior to the adoption of the Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan (Ordinance Number 18-124) as it related to density, and stated the covenant was proffered in response to staffï¿½s recommendations to ensure the zoning remained compatible with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP). Mr. Vazquez recounted the applicantï¿½s repeated efforts to negotiate with the residents and reported the applicant was now prepared to amend the newly proffered covenant to restrict the building height to three (3) stories along the busway and two (2) stories along the area abutting the single family home development.  He commented on the importance of securing federal funding to fund the Countyï¿½s SMART Planï¿½s objectives and argued single family homes along a transit-oriented corridor/busway would not secure federal funding.  Mr. Vazquez noted the newly revised covenant would continue to comply with the existing covenantï¿½s 40 foot buffer requirement and pointed out staff recommended approval. In response to Commissioner Heymanï¿½s inquiry as it related to the concessions made by the applicant regarding the building heights and the density for the proposed development, Mr. Vazquez estimated the reduced building heights would allow less than 400 units to be built. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing, and the following individuals appeared before the Board in opposition of the application: 1.   \tMr. Jorge Sosa, 28000 SW 157th Avenue, Miami,  Florida 2.   \tMr. David Pharo, 16370 SW 284th Street, Miami, Florida, argued the foregoing application was incompatible with the surrounding community and stated the applicant had been contentious and disingenuous from the start. 3.   \tMr. Hendrik Schorel, 28100 SW 157th Avenue, Miami,  Florida 4.   \tMr. Ernesto Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Miami, Florida, contended that the meetings with the applicant had been combative and threatening thus far and maintained the foregoing application was incompatible with the surrounding areas. 5.   \tMr. James Davison, 28105 SW 157th Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the group ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ and read into the record a letter opposing the foregoing application (See Exhibit 1-C). There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Vazquez defended the applicant, Mr. Gus Deribeaux (South Dixie 29, LLC), against allegations that he had been combative in his approach with the residents and reported Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbelï¿½s input at the last community meeting (5/12) was unbiased and productive.  He spoke about the challenging nature of the application and insisted that the applicant had made every reasonable effort to work with the residents. Mr. Vazquez recounted the applicantï¿½s proposal to limit the building height to three (3) stories along the busway, two (2) stories abutting the single family home development, and comply with the 40 foot buffer requirement as delineated in the existing covenant. Commissioner Heyman inquired about the status and validity of covenants proffered during the CZAB proceedings.  She also requested Mr. Davison to submit his statement/letter to the Clerkï¿½s Office to be made part of the record (See Exhibit 1-C). Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that covenants proffered to the CZAB became part of the zoning resolution and clarified that he never stated the covenant was not enforceable or illegal. Discussions ensued between Commissioner Heyman and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding the validity of the covenant in question and the authority of the Board to enforce or modify the terms. Commissioner Heyman commended Commissioner Cohen Higgins for engaging the community and navigating the numerous applications from her commission district.  She voiced her concerns about the nature of the proposed development and the applicantï¿½s original plans to build 1,350 residential units, noting the existing covenant limited development to 29 single family homes. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that while the covenant limited development of the subject site to 29 units, due to the current EU-M zoning designation, development would be limited to 29 EU-M residential units. Mr. Kogon clarified that the existing covenant applied to 11 out of the 15 acres in question.  He advised the options available to the Board were either to preserve the covenant for the 11 acres and decide on the zoning designation for the remaining four (4) acres or to modify the existing covenant.  Mr. Kogon pointed out the applicant was requesting the Board delete the existing covenant and replace it with a newly proffered declaration of restrictions. Commissioner Heyman stated while she acknowledged the compromises made by the applicant, she could not support the deletion of the existing covenant. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Martinez and Mr. Kogon regarding the creation of the Leisure City Community Urban Center District (LCCUCD). Commissioner Martinez indicated his intent to support the District Commissionerï¿½s decision and stated that while the LCCUCD was created to increase the density along the transit corridor in keeping with County policy, he did not believe policies could or should be applied universally. Acknowledging the residentsï¿½ concerns regarding the applicantï¿½s request to rezone the property to allow for increased density, Commissioner Regalado contended that it was difficult to ï¿½hold the lineï¿½ without increasing density in other areas, in this case along transit corridors.  She indicated her intent to support the district commissionerï¿½s decision and spoke about her personal experience living in a rapid transit zone and the need for balance. Chairman Diaz concurred with the comments made by his colleagues and voiced his intent to support the district commissionerï¿½s decision. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Mr. Vazquez regarding the purchase date of the subject property and the timeframe in which the foregoing application was filed. Mr. Gus Deribeaux, 7975 SW 108th Street, Miami, Florida, reported the subject property was purchased at the end of 2018; and the foregoing application was filed in 2019. Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ questions as to the date the existing covenant was filed and the SMART Planï¿½s adoption date, Mr. Kogon noted the covenant was recorded on August 3, 2018; and the SMART Plan was adopted in 2016 with the densities associated with the SMART Plan being adopted in 2019. Commissioner Cohen Higgins acknowledged the discrepancy between the Countyï¿½s SMART Plan policy to increase density along transit oriented corridors and the existing covenant restricting development.  She noted that while the property was purchased before the SMART Plan density policy was adopted, the applicant purchased the subject property merely months after the existing covenant was recorded and was fully aware that the covenant was valid for 30 years and restricted development on a portion of the subject property (11 acres) to 29 units. Commissioner Cohen Higgins contended it would be unfair to the residents if the Board were to invalidate the existing covenant given the timeframe the covenant was registered.  She stated that while it was her intent that the applicant and residents meet to resolve concerns regarding the application, she believed the foregoing application was unique in that not all properties located along transit-oriented corridors was tied to a recent covenant; therefore, moved to deny the foregoing application. Hearing no further questions or comments, the motion to deny was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-19-21. 3/17/2021 Deferred by the Zoning Board 4/21/2021 Deferred by the Zoning Board APPEAL ITEMS 2A 211227 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2020000004  --  DISTRICT(S): 8  --  APPLICANT: JOANNPICANES, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING APPROVAL OF A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM AU, AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT TO EU-M, SINGLE-FAMILY MODIFIED ESTATE.  --  LOCATION: LYING WEST OF SW 132 AVENUE AT SW 189 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation Zoning Z-20-21 Mover: Danielle Cohen Higgins Seconder: Sally A.

He advised the Board members that the foregoing application was an appeal and a two-thirds vote of the Board members present was needed to overturn the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s (CZAB) denial. Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, JoannPicanes, LLC., and provided a brief PowerPoint presentation review of the foregoing application.  He noted the applicant was seeking a district boundary change from Agricultural District (AU) to Single-Family Modified Estate (EU-M), which was compatible with the surrounding area and the transitional development trend for the neighborhood.  Mr. Vazquez pointed out the Board of County Commissioners (Board) approved an application in October 2020 to rezone 41 acres located to the west of the subject property to EU-M.  He advised the Board members that there was an existing covenant which limited development of the subject site to 12 single family homes and stated in order for the development to be consistent with the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP), the project would have to be compliant with EU-M regulations. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following individual appeared before the Board in opposition of the application: Ms. Alicia Arellano, 18701 SW 134th Avenue, Miami, Florida, argued the foregoing application request was incompatible with the neighborhood.  She noted ongoing construction in the area was affecting the air quality and resulted in health issues for residents and animals.  Ms. Arellano pointed out construction vehicles were restricted from utilizing SW 132nd Avenue, which would make construction on the subject property virtually impossible. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated that upon her review of the transcript of the CZAB proceedings related to the foregoing application, she found repeated reference to a Lennar Homes project by the two (2) residents who appeared in opposition of the application.  She clarified the foregoing item was unrelated to the Lennar Homes project and commented that she believed the proposed development was compatible with the surrounding area.  Commissioner Cohen Higgins moved to approve the foregoing application consistent with staffï¿½s recommendation. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application as amended. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-20-21.

Ms. Melissa Tapanes Llahues, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin & Tapanes, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 300, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, GC3 Development, LLC.; and with the aid of a PowerPoint Presentation, provided a brief review of the foregoing application highlighting the project history, description, and the alternative plan for the subject property.  She noted that, along with staffï¿½s positive recommendation and the Sunset Galloway Homeowners Associationï¿½s (SGHA) support for the application, the applicant was seeking the Board of County Commissionersï¿½ (Board) approval of the application ï¿½in partï¿½ to allow the development of the subject property, pursuant to the updated covenant (See Exhibit 3B).  Ms. Tapanes Llahues reassured the Board members that the applicant was prepared to continue negotiations with the surrounding community to resolve their concerns and maintained that the proposed development was compatible with the surrounding area. Ms. Tapanes Llahues reiterated the applicantï¿½s efforts to meet with the SGHA residents to address their concerns were successful.  She advised the Board members that she received correspondence on May 13, 2021, from a group representing the ï¿½Glenvar Heights Estates (GHE)ï¿½ claiming they were not notified of previous meetings and noted subsequent attempts to schedule a meeting with the group were rejected.  Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out the address for the representative of the GHE group was outside the notice ï¿½half mile radiusï¿½ requirement and restated the applicantï¿½s willingness to meet with the group to address their concerns.  She stated she believed much of the groupï¿½s objection to the application was based on misinformation and clarified a full traffic impact study was completed at the request of the SGHA. Responding to Commissioner Martinezï¿½s question as to whether a public hearing had been held on the foregoing application, Mr. Kogon clarified that the Board considered a Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) amendment application in 2018 and noted this was the first time the zoning application was being considered by the Board. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared before the Board in opposition of the application: 1.   \t Mr. Lance Kyle, 7475 SW 102nd Street, Miami, Florida, voiced his concerns about the   applicantï¿½s request for variances and the Countyï¿½s continued trend towards urbanization. 2.   \tMs. Patricia Kyle, 7475 SW 102nd Street, Miami, Florida, owner of Galloway Farm Nursery, stated that she originally attended todayï¿½s (5/19) meeting to oppose the three (3) story proposed development but was now satisfied with the applicantï¿½s plan to limit the height to two (2) stories.  She noted that she was still concerned about the traffic impact the proposed development would have on the surrounding area. 3.   \tMs. Marielena ï¿½Maryï¿½ Faraldo, 7120 SW 80th Street, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the GHE group and disputed Ms. Tapanes Llahuesï¿½ representations that the group refused to meet with the applicant.  She noted the group included residents from approximately 200 homes located along Miller Drive to 80th Street; and 87th Avenue to 72nd Avenue and argued the foregoing application was incompatible with the surrounding communities and existing zoning designations. Ms. Faraldo voiced her concerns about the increased density and traffic impact on the community, citing a traffic study commissioned by GHE in 2017. 4.   \tMs. Alina Lobaina, 8454 SW 76th Terrace, Miami, Florida, contended the applicantï¿½s traffic study was performed in June 2020, during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when there was much less vehicular traffic on the roadways and requested an updated traffic study be done. 5.   \tMr. Emilio Fuster, 7500 SW 86th Court, Miami, Florida, voiced his opposition to the applicantï¿½s original plans to build a three (3) story building on the subject property and the impact on the surrounding community, particularly the plant nursery. He stated that while he acknowledged and did not oppose the most recent changes proposed in the applicantï¿½s latest plans, he would request the applicant increase the height of the privacy wall from six (6) feet to eight (8) feet and inquired about the applicantï¿½s landscaping buffering plans for the north side of the subject property which contained Florida Power and Light Company (FP&L) electrical lines. 6.   Mr. Robert Hernandez, RHF Law Firm, 2600 South Douglas Road, Coral Gables, Florida, appeared on behalf of the SGHA, which consisted of 153 homes, the largest community impacted by the foregoing application.  He noted the SGHA fully supported the applicantï¿½s revised plans and stated he believed the application was now compatible with the surrounding community.  Mr. Hernandez withdrew the SGHAï¿½s objections to the proposed application in light of the applicantï¿½s scaled down plans. There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Ms. Tapanes Llahues clarified the applicant had withdrawn the height variance request and pointed out the only remaining variance request would allow for the eight (8) foot privacy wall to be built pursuant to the proffered covenant.  She also noted that the covenant required the applicant to ï¿½undergroundï¿½ the FP&L electrical line located to the north of the subject property. Responding to Ms. Lobainaï¿½s representation that the traffic study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out that while the foregoing application did not require a traffic study, the applicant had agreed to commission one at the request of the SGHA and noted the study was performed in January 2020, prior to the pandemic.  She explained the study was dated June 2020 due to numerous revisions done in response to the Countyï¿½s traffic engineering staff comments. Commissioner Regalado recognized the changes made by the applicant to the foregoing application and thanked the applicant for the clarification provided regarding the traffic study.  She stated she believed the application was consistent with the Countyï¿½s policies and contended the proposed development was not a case of urbanization. Commissioner Regalado voiced her concerns regarding the use of palm trees for the landscaping buffer and the statement that the applicant had not met with the GHE residents. Commissioner Regalado reviewed several changes made by the applicant including the relocation of the sewer pump station, modifying the garbage disposal hours of operation and the location of the loading zone.  She stated that she believed much of the concerns voiced by the GHE group had already been remedied by the applicant and asked whether the applicant was amenable to meeting with the GHE residents. Ms. Tapanes Llahues stated that while the GHE group was newly formed and was not registered to conduct business in the State of Florida, the applicant was amenable to meeting with the residents today (5/19) or during the permitting process.  She noted the applicant had entered into a contractual obligation regarding the purchase of the subject property, which was time sensitive, and requested the Board approve the foregoing application. Commissioner Regalado requested the applicant meet with the GHE group to address their traffic concerns.  She also requested the applicant revisit the buffer landscaping plans and incorporate bio-diverse trees to the tree canopy. Ms. Tapanes Llahues pointed out that the applicant was under contract to purchase the oak trees from the oak tree nursery located at the rear of the subject property and relocate them on site, pursuant to the covenant proffered at the CDMP proceedings. Mr. Kogon reviewed the foregoing application requests before the Board for approval. Upon the conclusion of extensive discussions on the foregoing application, Commissioner Regalado moved to approve the application as amended to rezone the subject property to RU-5A (Semi-Professional Office District), delete the Declarations of Restrictions as recorded in the Official Record Books (ORB) 12475-2287 and ORB 16007-4502, delete Conditions #4, #5 and #9 of Resolution #4-ZAB-99-93, Modify Condition #2 of Resolution #4-ZAB-99-93 to allow the development of the property consistent with the proffered covenant, deny the height variance and accept the proffered covenant, and approve the non-use variance to allow the 8 feet privacy wall; along with the additional condition that the applicant meet with the group identified as ï¿½Glenvar Heightsï¿½ to address their traffic and landscaping buffer concerns. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application as amended. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-21-21. ADJOURNMENT REPORT: All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s (5/19) Zoning meeting were transferred to the care, custody, and control of the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER).

Caves, Rambo Holdings, LLC., and Adriano Marcos Lambe; and provided a brief overview of the foregoing application.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to engage the community and noted aside from one resident, Mr. William Ingram, who opposed the application, the other neighbors had submitted a letter supporting the item (See Exhibit 2A). Mr. Mayol published a PowerPoint presentation highlighting: ~\tGeneral property information including the subject propertyï¿½s location and proximity to the South Dade Transit-way; ~\tZoning classifications for the surrounding area; ~\tDevelopable areas of the County; ~\tMiami-Dade County population growth rate; ~\tThe subject propertyï¿½s proximity to mass public transit; ~\tShort range Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP); ~\tNeighborhood outreach summary and timeline; ~\tProffered declaration of restrictions (See Exhibit 2A1): ~\tMaximum permitted density limited to 148 units with larger lots along the north and west sides of the property consistent with the Single-Family Estate Use Suburban (EU-S) zoning designation standards; ~\tNotice to future owners or lessees of the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to the Ingram Pineland Preserve (IPP); ~\tPerimeter landscape buffers between the proposed residential units and the IPP; ~\tConnection to the sanitary sewer and public water infrastructure; ~\tAdditional right-of-way landscaping along the east side of the subject property (SW 169th Avenue) with mature trees 14-16 feet in height, planted twenty five (25) feet on center; and ~\tFinancial contributions to Avocado Elementary and South Dade Senior High Schoolsï¿½ Parents Teachersï¿½ Associations (PTAs). ~\tPreservation and relocation of the Caves bungalow; ~\tDifferences between EU-S and Single-Family Modified Estate (EU-M) units; ~\tRenderings of the proposed development/homes; ~\tEstimated impact fees per unit; ~\tApproval/No objections from reviewing departments; and ~\t2021 Urban Expansion Area (UEA) report. Mr. Mayol pointed out, despite the southeast corner of the subject propertyï¿½s location within the one (1) mile distance radius of a transit oriented corridor, which would allow the applicant to potentially develop additional density on the site, the applicant was not seeking to develop additional density but instead chose to continue to develop consistent with the existing estate density designation. Mr. Mayol advised the Board members that based on the proffered covenant the resident group identified as ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ had issued a letter (See Exhibit 2A) stating they had no objections to the approval of the foregoing application and requested the applicant consider including the following three (3) additional amendments to the proffered covenant: ~\tThe applicant post a bond prior to the relocation of the Caves bungalow to guarantee the safe preservation and relocation of the structure; ~\tProvide larger EU-S like lots for the portion of the subject property directly abutting the Single-Family One Acre Estate District (EU-1) lots located to the north of the subject property, including the IPP; ~\tRezone the portion of the subject site described as having EU-S like lots fronting SW 288th Street and SW 172nd Avenue to an EU-S designation. Addressing the neighborsï¿½ requests, Mr. Mayol indicated, in consultation with the Historic Preservation Office, the applicant had determined that the County did not require a bond to relocate the bungalow.  He reassured the Board members that the structure would be relocated, if permitted, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ï¿½Certificate of Appropriateness (COA)ï¿½ from the Historic Preservation Board (HPB) and noted the bungalow would be incorporated into the development. Mr. Mayol explained the applicant had already decreased the developmentï¿½s density as much as possible, and as such would be unable to provide the larger lots as requested by the neighbors.  He stated he did not believe rezoning the properties fronting SW 288th Street and SW 172nd Avenue was necessary since the applicant would be developing those plots consistent with EU-S standards. Mr. Mayol requested the Board approve the foregoing application per staff recommendation and acceptance of the revised covenant. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing, and the following individuals appeared before the Board of County Commissioners (Board) in support of the foregoing application: 1.  \tMr. Efren Nunez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the group ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ and noted the group conditionally supported the foregoing application subject to the incorporation of the conditions listed in the letter (See Exhibit 2A). 2.  \tMr. Ken Forbes, 25101 SW 130th Avenue, Homestead, Florida, appeared on behalf of the Naranja League of City Community Advisory Board and the Naranja Lakes Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA).  He stated that while the subject property was located just outside the CRAï¿½s boundary, he believed the foregoing application was compatible with the organizationï¿½s redevelopment plans for the area and would enhance the community. 3.  \tMr. J.L. Demps Jr., 11025 SW 223rd Street, Goulds, Florida, acknowledged the concessions made by the applicant in the proffered covenant and stated the foregoing application was compatible with the redevelopment plans for the area. 4.  \tMs. Pearlie Butler, 26615 SW 137th Court, Homestead, Florida, appeared as a member of the Naranja Advisory Board in support of the foregoing application. 5.  \tMr. David Pharo, 16370 SW 284th Street, Homestead, Florida, appeared on behalf of the group ï¿½Concerned Citizens of South Dadeï¿½ in support of the application. 6.  \tMs. Bessie Young, 28104 SW 143rd Court, Homestead, Florida. 7.  \tMr. Derril Young, 28104 SW 143rd Court, Homestead, Florida. The following speakers appeared in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.  \tMr. William Ingram, 16840 SW 288th Street, Homestead, Florida. 2.  \tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami, Florida. Mr. Justin Michel (phonetic), 980 Little River Drive, Miami, Florida, voiced his concerns regarding a citation issued to him for the improper installation of speed bumps on his property. Commissioner Monestime noted Mr. Michel was a resident of his Commission District and stated his staff would meet with him to address his concerns.  He pointed out the concerns raised by Mr. Michel (phonetic) were not related to any items on todayï¿½s (6/16) Zoning agenda. There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Mr. Mayol noted the subject property was currently designated as ï¿½estate densityï¿½ on the Countyï¿½s Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP), which allowed the applicant to rezone to either EU-M, EU-S, or EU-1 zoning classification, all of which were present in the surrounding area.  He thanked the neighbors for their input and continued cooperation and reiterated his request to approve the foregoing application per staff recommendation. Commissioner Cohen Higgins requested clarification as to what aspects of the application had changed since the CZABï¿½s denial on April 8, 2021.  She also thanked the residents for their input at todayï¿½s (6/16) meeting and commended the applicant on their ongoing efforts to work with the community. Mr. Mayol identified three (3) major changes made by the applicant since the CZABï¿½s denial.  He explained the applicant had agreed to limit the development to a maximum of 148 residential units by building EU-S lots along SW 288th Street and SW 172nd.  Mr. Mayol stated at the time the application was considered by the CZAB, the future of the Caves bungalow was uncertain, and noted the applicant had since committed to relocating the structure to its original location on the subject property. Commissioner Cohen Higgins noted there was a meeting scheduled later today (6/16) before the HPB to discuss the Caves bungalow and inquired about the possible outcome.  She also inquired about the incorporation of the bungalow into the new development. Mr. Mayol clarified todayï¿½s (6/16) meeting before the HPB was simply to initiate the historic designation process.  He expressed his confidence that the HPB would authorize the initiation of the designation process based on the comprehensive reports provided by staff and explained once the bungalow was designated a ï¿½historicï¿½ structure, the applicant would be required to secure two (2) COAs.  Mr. Mayol noted the first certificate would allow the applicant to repair and/or alter the structure, while the second COA facilitated the relocation of the bungalow to its new location on the subject property. He stated in the event the bungalow was not designated a ï¿½historicï¿½ structure, the applicant would be free to demolish the building. Mr. Mayol pointed out the relocation of the ï¿½Krome Houseï¿½ had set a precedent for the repositioning of historic structures and reiterated his confidence that the HPB would designate the bungalow a historic structure.  He explained the applicantï¿½s plans to relocate the bungalow to a larger lot alongside a newly built private residence and stated the EU-M zoning designation allowed for the bungalow to be used as a guest quarters or home office.  Mr. Mayol added the new property owner would be responsible for preserving, maintaining, and securing approval to make changes to the bungalow in accordance with the HPB requirements. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Mr. Mayol regarding the permanent protections offered under the historic designation process. Commissioner Cohen Higgins indicated her support for the foregoing application based on the communityï¿½s support for the item and the traffic concurrency review and concessions made by the applicant; including but not limited to, the proposed developmentï¿½s connection to sanitary sewer and public water infrastructure, and the $10,000 financial contributions to the two (2) school PTAs. Commissioner Sosa expressed concerns about using oak trees as landscape buffering and commended the applicant for the concessions made. She noted oak trees were aesthetically beautiful but could potentially destroy homes and sidewalks as they matured.  Commissioner Sosa expressed her support for the application and requested Commissioner Cohen Higgins consider including language urging the use of native, non-invasive trees as a condition of approval. Commissioner Sosa indicated her intent to introduce legislation which would prohibit the use of invasive trees for landscaping. Commissioner Heyman stated in the event the bungalow was not declared a historic structure, she would encourage the applicant to transfer ownership to any other interested party to relocate the building instead of demolishing it. Mr. Mayol pointed out that the Dade Heritage Trust had indicated its support for the bungalow to be designated a historic structure.  He reassured the Board members that the applicant would not demolish the structure without seeking staff input on transferring ownership in the event the structure was not declared a historic structure. Commissioner Heyman indicated her support for the application. Commissioner Regalado echoed the concerns voiced by Commissioner Heyman regarding the need for an alternative plan in the event the bungalow was not designated a historic structure.  She commended the applicantï¿½s novel idea of incorporating the bungalow as a part of a private residence and recognized the merits of the plan.  Commissioner Regalado opined the same approach could be adopted as a long term maintenance solution for other historic properties in the County. Addressing concerns expressed by Commissioner Sosa regarding the use of oak trees for buffering landscape, Commissioner Regalado noted the applicant had already agreed to participate in the Countyï¿½s Division of Environmental Resources Management (DERM) Environmentally Endangered Lands (EEL) Program and suggested the applicant expand and incorporate the same language as it applied to landscaping buffering for the entire development.  She pointed out the landscaping plans did not address biodiversity and urged the applicant to avoid the use of palm trees while incorporating biodiverse native plant species. Mr. Mayol clarified that the language contained in the covenant related to the perimeter landscape buffer was flexible in that it stated the applicant would use ï¿½live oak trees (or such other similar shade tree species as may be approved by the Countyï¿½s Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources.ï¿½ Prior to the roll call vote, Commissioners Monestime and Hardemon noted for the record that they were both fully apprised on the foregoing application and had been listening to the proceedings prior to their arrival. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application per staff recommendation; and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions, and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-23-21.

Commissioner Cohen Higgins indicated her support for the foregoing application. She stated she had received sufficient information regarding the item, therefore a full presentation from the applicant was not needed. Upon review of the speakersï¿½ cards, Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and noted there was no one registered to speak in opposition of the application.  He requested speakers appearing in support of the foregoing application to ï¿½waveï¿½ in lieu of addressing the Board of County Commissioners (Board). In addition to the persons waving in support of the item, the following individuals appeared before the Board: 1.  \tMr. Manuel Lacayo, student, spoke in support of the application noting the benefits of expanding the school for future generations to come. 2.  \tMr. Matthew Fleury, student, expressed his appreciation to the Somerset Academy Charter High school for being a safe haven for himself and numerous other students.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing, and there being no one registered or wishing to speak, closed the public hearing. Commissioner Monestime requested clarification regarding the scope of the application and asked whether the applicant planned on consolidating other parcels of property to maximize the development. Mr. Jorge Navarro, Greenberg Traurig, 333 SE 2nd Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Ades Family Foundation (AFF), Inc., a non-profit organization providing services and assistance to the Jewish community.  He noted AFF had purchased four (4) acres of land along NW 95th Street to build a school campus and was in the process of purchasing additional land along the north perimeter of the subject property for open space/recreational facilities.  Mr. Navarro explained the proposed development would be limited to a series of two (2) story school buildings. Mr. Navarro noted the subject property was located within an urban center and was currently undergoing the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question as to whether the application for the school would be considered by the Board of County Commissioners, Mr. Kogon explained schools were permitted ï¿½by rightï¿½ under the ï¿½Mixed-use Corridor (MC)ï¿½ zoning designation, thus the applicantï¿½s current engagement in the ASPR approval process. Mr. Navarro reviewed the intent of the foregoing application. Commissioner Sosa inquired about the heights of the proposed buildings and voiced her concerns about constructing eight (8) story buildings so close to a residential area. Mr. Navarro reported the applicant had proffered a covenant limiting the height of the buildings to three (3) stories, as allowed under the existing ï¿½Bungalow Court Districtï¿½ (RU-3B) zoning designation.  He pointed out the actual design of the buildings included in the site plan depicted two (2) stories.

Vice Chairman Gilbert III opened the public hearing, and the following individuals appeared before the Board of County Commissioners (Board) in support of the foregoing application: 1.  \tMr. Jean Fleurentin, 915 NE 122nd Street, North Miami, Florida 2.  \tMs. Josette Pierre, 420 NW 148th Street, Miami, Florida 3.  \tMr. Joseph Deceus, 430 NW 148th Street, Miami, Florida 4.  \tMs. Naomi Blemur, 685 NE 126th Street, North Miami, Florida, spoke about the Countyï¿½s dire need for affordable housing options. 5.  \tMr. Connie Nappier, 9301 NE 4th Avenue, Miami, Florida. 6.  \tMr. Terry Louis, 1230 NW 120th Street, Miami, Florida. 7.  \tMr. Rodney Murray, 14801 NW 5th Avenue, Miami, Florida, spoke about the financial difficulties and challenges he had encountered as an ex-military member in finding local affordable housing options. 8.  \tMs. Sandy Dorsainvil, 53 NE 69th Street, Miami, Florida. The following speakers appeared in opposition of the foregoing application: 1.  \tMr. Daniel Gualtieri, 360 NE 152nd Street, Miami, Florida, with the aid of an aerial map identified the subject property and surrounding parcels of land earmarked for development.  He cited concerns of overdevelopment in the area which would lead to additional traffic congestion and increased flooding.  Mr. Gualtieri requested a development moratorium be implemented until the County Administrationï¿½s traffic and flood study report of the area was completed. 2.  \tMs. Margaret Reid, 14621 N. Spur Drive, Miami, Florida, argued the proposed development was not compatible with the area and voiced her concerns about increased flooding, traffic congestion and inadequate parking capacity to support the project. 3.  \tMs. Diane Williams, 484 NW 165th Street, Miami, Florida, urged the Board to preserve the existing covenant and zoning designation citing concerns regarding increased density and overdevelopment.  She spoke about the developerï¿½s history of remodeling other developments and argued the remodeling was poorly executed. 4.  \tMs. Anneris Ferreira, 484 NW 165th Street, Miami, Florida, echoed the concerns voiced by the previous speakers. 5.  \tMs. Maria Perilli, 14611 N.

He asserted that the applicant failed to engage the community and requested the application be denied. 7.  \tMs. Laurel Fennell, 312 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida. 8.  \tMr. Marvin Ramsey, President of the Biscayne Gardens Civic Association, 326 NE 152nd Street, Miami, Florida, requested the Board implement a moratorium on development in the area until the County Administrationï¿½s traffic and flood study report of the area was completed.  He argued that the proposed development was incompatible with the area and spoke about the applicantï¿½s unwillingness to compromise or engage the community. 9.  \tDr. Dana Fennell, 312 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, spoke about the negative social impact of overdevelopment on neighborhoods and quality of life. 10.  \t Ms. Estomere Dorale, 110 NE 152nd Street, Miami, Florida, echoed the concerns expressed by the previous speakers. 11.  \tMs. Suzie Stephen, 14735 N. Spur Drive, Miami, Florida, complained about flooding in the area and stated she was concerned the proposed development would only worsen the situation. 12.  \tMr. Miguel Valentin, 295 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, noted the community was inundated with traffic and flooding issues and contended the proposed development would exacerbate the situation. 13.  \tMr. Luis Pirella, 486 NW 165th Street Road, Miami, Florida, voiced his concerns regarding overdevelopment of the area and the lack of proper planning and infrastructure to support the growth. 14.  \tMs. Cordelia Wright, 21 NE 160th Street, North Miami Beach, Florida, spoke about the various projects earmarked for the area and echoed the concerns expressed by the previous speakers regarding flooding.  She requested the developers coordinate their efforts to address the residentsï¿½ needs. 15.  \tMr. Keith Hall, 390 NW 153rd Street, Miami, Florida. 16.  \tMr. Fred Vickory, 295 N Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, urged the Board to uphold the existing zoning designation and covenant. 17.  \tMr. Jamil Smith, 570 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, stated that while he was not opposed to development in the area he was concerned about the impact of the projectï¿½s density on the already strained traffic infrastructure and encouraged building more single family units. 18.  \tMr. Dwayne Wynn, 566 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, noted as a first responder he was concerned about the emergency response times for the area given the traffic congestion issue. 19.  \tMs. Charesse Chester, 501 N. Biscayne River Drive, Miami, Florida, voiced her concerns regarding the overdevelopment of the area. She argued the proposed project was incompatible with the area and reported there had been no community engagement by the applicant.  Ms. Chester urged the Board to defer the item until the County Administrationï¿½s traffic and flood study report was completed. 20.  \tMs. Linda Joseph, 275 NW 157th Street, Miami, Florida, emphasized the communityï¿½s opposition to the proposed development. There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Vice Chairman Gilbert III closed the public hearing. Mr. Pedro Gassant, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 3300, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, BHI Montebella, LLC., and provided a brief review of the application.  He noted the proposed development application allocated twenty percent (20%) of the units to workforce housing and argued the location of the subject property was ideal for such use.  Mr. Gassant emphasized the Countyï¿½s need for workforce housing and the Boardï¿½s commitment to building 10,000 workforce housing units. Mr. Gassant stated the applicant, in an attempt to compromise with the community, had reduced the number of units from 588 to 425; and the building height from seven (7) to five (5) stories.  He reported that, despite the applicantï¿½s best efforts to engage the residents, an agreement with the community was not reached due to the residentsï¿½ inability to differentiate the foregoing proposed application from the numerous other developments planned for the area. Mr. Gassant, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation, provided a brief review of the foregoing application highlighting the following: ~\tMiami-Dade County Population Growth Rate ~\tRapidly Rising Rents = Severely High Cost-Burdened Renters ~\tCost Burdened Renters ~\tDemographics Analysis II ~\tExecutive Summary ~\tProperty ~\tProposed Development ~\tUrbanized Area ~\tGolden Glades Transportation Facility ~\tApplication No. 2 Oct 2018 Cycle ~\tDeveloper off Site Improvements ï¿½ If Application Approved ~\tEstimated Impact Fees ~\tSite Plan ï¿½ Landscaping Plan Rendering ~\tDepiction of Development ï¿½ AHS Development ~\tDepartmental Approvals ~\tAHS Tamiami ï¿½ Example ï¿½ Typical Interior Finishes ~\tAHS Residential Community Outreach ï¿½ Mission Commissioner Regalado requested clarification as to the location of the subject property and the water service area provider. Mr. Kogon stated that, while the subject property was located in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, the water service area was listed as the City of North Miami Beach. Mr. Gassant clarified that the subject property was serviced by Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD) while the property parcels located across the street on the south side were serviced by the City of North Miami Beach.  He reassured the Board members that there were no water main line issues and explained that the Department of Environmental Resources Management (DERM) typically included language in all analyses and comments regarding the existing consent decree.  Mr. Gassant reported that the proposed project would be connected to public water and sewer. Commissioner Regalado pointed to a discrepancy in WASDï¿½s memorandum dated August 7, 2020, (Page 26 of the application attachments), which stated the proposed development was located within the City of North Miami Beachï¿½s water service area. Commissioner Monestime thanked the public for their comments on the foregoing application and inquired about staffï¿½s recommendations for the project, if approved, regarding the traffic, sewer, and stormwater issues. Mr. Kogon advised that the subject property was located in the urban infill area, therefore concurrency was not mandated.  He stated in addition to the traffic study, the existing transit plans were also considered and noted in the event the foregoing application was approved, the developer was required to comply with the February 25, 2021, Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) Traffic Engineering Division (TED) memorandum relating to roadway improvements to NW 2nd Avenue, which required providing more capacity and access to north 167th Avenue. Mr. Kogon noted that the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) required on-site stormwater storage and explained that the applicant was required by County Code, to provide adequate infrastructure and improvements on site.  He clarified that while the water service area was listed as the City of North Miami Beach, Miami-Dade County provided sewer service for the subject property.  Mr. Kogon advised the Board members that there was an existing sewer line located on NW 2nd Avenue and NW 159th Street that allowed the developer access to connect and extend the service to the subject property. Commissioner Monestime inquired about the timeframe for the submittal of the pending traffic and flood study report and asked whether there were any other measures the developer could implement to further mitigate the areaï¿½s traffic and stormwater issues. Mr. Jerry Bell, Assistant Director for Planning, RER, stated the traffic study provided staff an opportunity to take a more holistic look at the area to identify improvements, specifically related to the five percent (5%) rule on traffic mitigation requirements.  He noted different departments were working on the report and anticipated it would be completed within ninety (90) days. Commissioner Monestime stated that, while he recognized the compromises made by the applicant to date, he was concerned that the residents were unaware of the changes to the proposed application and project and encouraged more dialogue between the two parties. Mr. Gassant reassured the Board members that the applicant had been in contact with the Biscayne Gardens Civic Association. Commissioner Monestime voiced his concerns regarding the sizes of the units, particularly the three (3) bedroom units. Commissioner Heyman indicated her support for the foregoing application, particularly the workforce housing component, and inquired about the proposed developmentï¿½s impact on the surrounding schools. Mr. Kogon explained a ï¿½planning level analysisï¿½ was completed and the School Board determined there was currently available capacity at the elementary, middle, and high schools.   He noted a secondary review would be performed as the process progressed and the applicant may be required to pay a mitigation fee in the event the capacity decreased. Returning to address Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s concerns regarding the unitsï¿½ sizes, Mr. Gassant reported the applicant was prepared to increase the three (3) bedroom unit size to 1100 square feet.  He reassured the Board members that the developer, AHS Residential, had built four (4) other local developments with similar unit sizes for workforce housing. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel regarding the applicationï¿½s process following the Boardï¿½s decision today (7/21). Commissioner Monestime stated that while he supported the applicantï¿½s request to permit fewer parking spaces than required by County Code given the subject propertyï¿½s proximity to mass transit access (Golden Glades Interchange), he remained apprehensive about the proposed unit sizes. Mr. Gassant reviewed the unit sizes and noted the proposed minimum unit size was 525 square feet for a one (1) bedroom unit with 810 square feet and 1100 square feet for a two (2) bedroom unit and three (3) bedroom unit, respectively. Commissioner Monestime inquired about the number of units permitted on the subject property. Mr. Gassant noted the applicant would be allowed to build up to 615 units including the workforce housing density bonus. Commissioner Monestime commended the applicantï¿½s efforts to reduce the proposed developmentï¿½s capacity and height given the communityï¿½s concerns. Commissioner Martinez pointed out that the developer had constructed a similar project in County Commission District 11 and praised the size, aesthetics, and amenities of the rental units and building complex.  He noted that he was aware of several rental developments that had requested parking variances and resulted in residents parking in the streets and swales due to insufficient parking spaces and urged Commissioner Monestime to maintain the Countyï¿½s parking requirements. Mr. Gassant withdrew the applicantï¿½s parking non-use variance request (Request #3). Commissioner Higgins commented on the issue of flooding and the importance of having green space areas and landscapes and inquired about the setbacks and workforce housing component given the capacity and height reductions. Mr. Gassant explained the building footprint would remain the same despite the height reduction and reassured the Board members that the applicant was committed to providing twenty percent (20%) workforce housing. Commissioner Higgins concurred with Commissioner Martinezï¿½s concerns regarding the need to provide sufficient parking spaces and voiced her concerns regarding the applicantï¿½s non-use variance request to permit a total of five (5) Electrical Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) parking spaces instead of the required 101 EVSE spaces.  She noted the County required new developments to wire parking garages to support ten percent (10%) of the total parking spaces as EVSE spots. Mr. Gassant withdrew the applicantï¿½s EVSE non-use variance request (Request #4). Discussion ensued between Chairman Diaz and Mr. Gassant regarding the reduction in units and pricing for the respective unit sizes. Mr. Gassant reviewed the pricing for the units and advised that while the applicant had committed to allocating and preserving twenty percent (20%) of the units for workforce housing needs, all of the rental units would be priced in accordance with workforce housing requirements. Chairman Diaz inquired about the applicantï¿½s plans for stormwater drainage and dealing with on-street flooding. Mr. Gassant explained that the development would access public sewer from NW 2nd Avenue and noted the applicant was required to maintain stormwater drainage on-site with an underground stormwater system. He stated the impact fees for the development would help mitigate street flooding. Additional discussion ensued between Chairman Diaz and Mr. Gassant regarding the stormwater drainage system requirements. Chairman Diaz voiced his concerns regarding the use of parks for the displacement of floodwaters and asked whether there were elements in the foregoing application that would help alleviate the issue. Mr. Kogon clarified zoning applications were required to provide equivalent compensation for the stormwater displaced by the proposed development, but not address off-site deficiencies. Chairman Diaz reiterated his concerns regarding on-street flooding caused by displacement due to the construction of the development and the proposed underground stormwater storage system. Discussion ensued between Chairman Diaz and Mr. Gassant regarding the number of parking spaces. Mr. Gassant noted the project would include 728 parking spaces, which was equivalent to the amount required given the project size and capacity. Commissioner Regalado pointed out the proffered covenant incorrectly stated that the development would receive public water service from WASD. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell advised the Planned Area Development (PAD) Agreement should be updated to replace the language in paragraph 10 to reflect ï¿½The property shall be connected to public water and sewer via a public utility.ï¿½ Commissioner Regalado concurred with Chairman Diaz regarding the underground stormwater storage system and noted the main on NW 2nd Avenue was not accessible to the community.  She urged staff to consider placing an easement in the area for a future pump station.  Commissioner Regalado spoke about Tri-Railï¿½s efforts to provide free transportation for ï¿½first/last mileï¿½ trips which would encourage residents without cars to use the system. Responding to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question as to when the plans for the underground water retention system would be made public, Mr. Kogon noted the plans were included as a part of the proffered covenant and in the application kit provided to the Board members.  He noted in the event the application was approved today (7/21), the applicant would be required to submit new plans illustrating the reduction in the number of building units and building height for administrative review. Commissioner Monestime inquired about the applicantï¿½s plans for engaging the community for design input. Mr. Gassant assured the Board members that the applicant was committed to engaging the community and agreed to provide the final plans for review to the Biscayne Gardens Civic Association prior to submittal to the County. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion before the Board was to accept the appeal and approve the application per staffï¿½s recommendation as modified below: ~ Accept the withdrawal of request number 3 related to the parking variance; ~ Accept the withdrawal of request number 4 related to the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) parking spaces variances; ~ Condition the deletion of the covenant (request number 2) on the submittal of a revised PAD agreement that reflects a reduction to 425 multi-family units and reduction in the height of the buildings to five (5) stories; ~ Condition the acceptance of the site plan based on the reduction to the number of building units and height; ~ Require the developer to present and provide proof that the final plans were provided to the Biscayne Gardens Civic Association for review prior to submittal to the County; ~Require the developer to comply with the February 25, 2021, Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) Traffic Engineering Division (TED) memorandum related to the roadway improvements to NW 2nd Avenue; ~ Update the PAD Agreement to replace the language in paragraph 10 to reflect ï¿½The property shall be connected to public water and sewer via a public utility.ï¿½ ~ Require the developer to pay the costs for any residential parking permits (to be included in the PAD Agreement). Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application as amended. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-27-21.

Regalado Seconder: Oliver G. Gilbert, III Vote: 10 - 2 No: Heyman , Martinez Absent, COI: Sosa REPORT: Following the adjournment of the Comprehensive Development Master Plan meeting, Chairman Diaz reconvened the Zoning meeting at 12:17 p.m. Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 981 protests and 495 waivers filed. Discussion ensued among various Board members and Ms. Eileen Ball Mehta, attorney for the applicant, regarding the applicantï¿½s presentation. Ms. Eileen Ball Mehta along with co-counsels Mr. Brian Adler, Mr. Howard Nelson and Ms. Liana Kozlowski, Bilzin Sumberg, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Kendall Associates I, LLLP et Al.  She invited supporters of the application to stand and filed for the record, 500 letters of support.  Ms. Mehta reviewed the applicantï¿½s request and emphasized the subject property was located within the Urban Development Boundary (UDB).  She reviewed the history of the subject property, specifically the release of the restrictions which limited use of the subject property for a golf course.  Ms. Mehta spoke about the lawsuit involving the previous property owners and the County, and pointed out the Boardï¿½s decision (See exhibit 1B-1) to remove the usage restrictions for the property settled the litigation matter and laid the framework for todayï¿½s application.  She stated the foregoing application resulted from the collaboration of homeowners and property owners and would provide much needed infill housing. Chairman Diaz noted that Board members may exit the chambers for lunch but would continue to monitor the proceedings. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, 3835 Utopia Court, Coconut Grove, Florida, appeared on behalf of the Save Calusa Trust (Trust), in support of the application.  He acknowledged the applicantï¿½s efforts to engage the community and urged the Board to approve the application per staff recommendation. Mr. Chad Freeman, 2525 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables, Florida, concurred with the comments made by co-counsel Mr. Gibbs and reiterated the Trustï¿½s support for the foregoing application. Ms. Mehta contended the majority of residents opposing the application did not reside on the ï¿½Ringï¿½ road and recognized that traffic issues were the primary point of contention in most zoning applications.  She acknowledged the applicantï¿½s need to address the communityï¿½s traffic concerns and contended the application not only satisfied the Countyï¿½s minimum Level of Service (LOS) standard criteria but also exceeded the required mitigation. Mr. Timothy Plummer, David Plummer & Associates, 1750 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables, Florida, spoke about the traffic challenges facing the Calusa area and with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation highlighted plans for the proposed development intended to mitigate traffic congestion in and around the Calusa Club Drive (SW 96th Street).  He explained the proposed projectï¿½s main entrance would be located at SW 97th Street with an exit point at SW 127th Avenue.  Mr. Plummer reported the Planning Traffic Studies and Zoning Traffic Study performed for the subject property satisfied the Countyï¿½s LOS and traffic concurrency standards. Mr. Plummer stated despite the fact that the application met all County LOS and traffic concurrency requirements, the applicant sought to further increase traffic capacity in the area and volunteered to provide the following additional roadway improvements: ~\tExtending the northbound turning lanes along SW 133rd Avenue and Kendall Drive; ~\tExtending the eastbound left turning lanes at SW 127th Avenue and SW 104th Street; ~\tExtending the eastbound left turning lanes at SW 122nd Avenue and SW 104th Street; ~\tCreating a ï¿½Turbo Laneï¿½ at SW 132nd Avenue and SW 104th Street; and ~\tProvide funding for adaptive signalization for three traffic signals on SW 104th Street. Mr. Plummer contended the ï¿½cut throughï¿½ issues facing the community was unrelated to the proposed project and was an ongoing issue.  He pointed out that the applicant was willing to work with the residents and pay for traffic calming efforts, including police enforcement a minimum of three (3) days per week. Mr. Plummer reviewed the ï¿½cut throughï¿½ issues and explained the traffic calming plans for the community proposed implementing the least restrictive options at first which would include prohibiting left turns at SW 104th Street and SW 128th Place from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. on weekdays, along with police enforcement.  He stated in the event these initiatives were unsuccessful, the applicant would modify the median to physically prohibit left turns.  Mr. Plummer noted the same efforts would be employed at all areas experiencing ï¿½cut throughï¿½ traffic issues and assured the Board members that the residents would be kept informed and involved in the process.  He emphasized that the residents must agree to participate in the traffic calming process by voting to accept the mitigation plans.  Mr. Plummer concluded that the proposed project would construct a main entrance point with signalized access on SW 127th Avenue, met Countyï¿½s LOS standards and traffic concurrency requirements, and would provide comprehensive off-site traffic improvement initiatives to reduce morning ï¿½cut through.ï¿½ Ms. Mehta noted in addition to the traffic mitigation efforts, the applicant had committed to paying approximately $9.5 million in impact fees to the County. Addressing concerns regarding the possibility that the subject property provided a unique critical habitat for endangered bat species, Ms. Mehta stated despite the experts inability to ascertain whether the area provided nesting or roosting habitat for the bats, the applicant had agreed to comply with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service best management practices which were included as a condition of the applicationï¿½s approval.  She noted that the applicant was also committed to expanding and enhancing the foraging habitats for endangered bat species as well as wading birds; and expressed the intent to further investigate the possibility that a tricolored heron bird was nesting on the subject property.  Ms. Mehta advised the Board members that there would be no development around the ï¿½tree islandï¿½ and that the applicant had agreed to perform monthly inspections over a six (6) month period to determine whether the area provided nesting and roosting habitat for endangered bat and bird species. Ms. Mehta noted that the applicant had retained ornithologist, Mr. Clive Petrovic, to develop a plan for enhancing onsite habitat for endangered bird species and reviewed his accreditations and accomplishments. Mr. Clive Petrovic, Roundhouse Chadwell Estates, Tortola, British Virgin Islands, recounted his professional accreditations and experience.  He noted the area was neither pristine nor natural and contended the presence of a single tricolored heron did not indicate the island was a natural nesting site. Mr. Petrovic maintained that the golf course ponds and surrounding shoreline vegetation were not essential feeding habitats.  He noted the proposed development plans included the addition of numerous ponds and native flora which would provide more typical conditions consistent with natural wetland feeding areas and make a better habitat for birds on the site.  Mr. Petrovic concluded that the subject property was not unique or special enough to foster the sustainability of tricolored heron or little blue heron birds on the site but stated with proper planning, the subject property could be better developed to support wading birds. Ms. Mehta reiterated the applicantï¿½s commitment to protecting the wildlife and improving the foraging habitats by working alongside the Countyï¿½s Division of Environmental Resources Management (DERM) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).  She clarified for the record that the tree island in question represented less than one tenth of one (1) percent of the subject property. Ms. Mehta noted Mr. Shane Johnson (environmental consultant) and Mr. Andy Dolkart (economic consultant) were present to answer any questions the Board may have. Mr. Richard Norwalk, Executive Vice President of G.L Homes, 1600 Sawgrass Corporate Parkway, Sunrise, Florida, with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation titled ï¿½Calusa Zoning Applicationï¿½ (See exhibit) provided a brief history of the subject property and highlighted elements of the application including the following: ~\tWorking from the inside-out for the resolutions; ~\tAbout G.L. Homes; ~\tCalusa Property (subject location); ~\tBringing down the temperature; ~\tConstructive Collaboration; ~\tElements of the proposed development/project: -\t550 Single family detached homes; -\t75 feet buffer around perimeter; -\tNo road closures to the backs of the surrounding homes; -\tNo less than 40% open space; -\tRecreation protects the privacy of adjacent homeowners; and -\tLot width minimums. ~\tPartial list of site planning goals; ~\tRenderings of the proposed development and home designs; ~\tDERM memo; ~\tCalusa Country Club Environmental Assessment Report which found no Florida bonneted bats or sign of bonneted bats roosted on the subject property; ~\tEnhanced Foraging Opportunities; ~\tTricolored Heron -\t DERM memo; -\tTree island area compared to the subject area; -\tCattle Egret Profile; ~\tTraffic/Road conditions at SW 97th Street; ~\tTraffic Mitigation Plans; ~\tMiami-Dade Urban Boundary; ~\tEconomic Impact Report (prepared by Andy Dolkart); and ~\tClosing statement/points. Ms. Mehta clarified the subject property was not a public park and noted there was precedent that the golf course could be redeveloped for residential uses. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and requested the speakers limit comments to one (1) minute. Mr. David Winker, 4720 S. Le Jeune Road, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the ï¿½Save Calusa Groupï¿½ and advised the Board members that he had submitted a notice of appearance, PowerPoint presentation and numerous letters of objection to the County Attorneyï¿½s Office and Clerkï¿½s Office regarding his representation of the group, at the last Zoning (10/20) meeting. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel clarified that the letter submitted by Mr. Winker did not specify a legal entity. Mr. Winker, with the aid of the PowerPoint presentation, reviewed County Code Section 33-310(g) and argued the foregoing application was not properly noticed for todayï¿½s (11/17) Zoning meeting following the cancellation of the October 20, 2021 Zoning meeting. He contended the subject property was currently vacant and zoned for ï¿½Parks and Recreation.ï¿½  Mr. Winker stated the foregoing application did not address issues related to properties designated for ï¿½Parks and Recreationï¿½ uses and referenced a letter dated July 21, 2005 addressed to Mr. Tim Foreman which identified restrictions for said designation. Mr. Winker asserted that the foregoing application failed to meet the Countyï¿½s planning objectives and commented on the price paid by the developer to acquire the property.  He spoke about the importance of preserving park and recreation spaces and pointed out the environmental studies were incomplete.  Mr. Winker complained about the lack of community engagement and contended supporters of the application benefited financially. He urged the Board to deny the application and read a statement regarding the environment impact into the record. The following individuals appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.   \tMr. Daniel Arguelles, appeared on behalf of the Kendall Federation of Homeownerï¿½s Association, 13281 SW 98th Street, Miami, Florida 2.   \tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami, Florida 3.   \tMr. Ray  Schooley, 16311 SW 173rd Avenue, Miami, Florida Chairman Diaz noted any PowerPoint presentations made by public speakers would also be limited to one (1) minute. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that all PowerPoint presentations were preserved for the record. 4.   \tMr. Joseph Brian Rapoza, appeared on behalf of the Tropical Audubon Society, 14525 SW 88th Street, Miami, Florida 5.   \tMr. Steven Leidner, 555 NE 34th Street, Miami, Florida 6.   \tMs. Vanessa Vazquez, 9301 W.

Calusa Club Drive, Miami, Florida stated that she was not opposed to developing the area but did not support building 550 homes on the subject site which were incompatible with the existing community. 22. \tMr. Derek Blassingame, no address provided, expressed his disappointment that the issue could not be resolved whereby current homeowners could continue to enjoy the green space while still allowing development on the property. 23. \tMr. Drew Martin, Conservation Chair for the Loxahatchee Group of the Sierra Club, 1015 North Elm Street, Miami, Florida questioned the lack of input from the Countyï¿½s Resiliency Department. 24. \tMs. Carolina Jackman, 13351 SW 90th Terrace, Miami, Florida The following individuals appeared before the Board in support of the item: 1.   \tMr. Rene Alvarez, 9241 SW 101st Street, Miami, Florida 2.   \tMs. Yesika Diaz, 12221 SW 121st Avenue, Miami, Florida 3.   \tMr. Mike Merino, 8820 SW 132nd Place, Miami, Florida 4.   \tMr. Michael Barela, President of Fox Electrics, 2045 Arch Creek Drive, North Miami, Florida, spoke about the quality of homes constructed by G.L Homes. Addressing comments made by Mr. Blassingame, Chairman Diaz reiterated that Board members exited the chambers for lunch but continued to monitor the proceedings. The following individuals requested the item be deferred for additional information: 1.   \tMr. Ron Magill, 13105 SW 107th Terrace, Miami, Florida requested the item be deferred to get additional information from the FWC. 2.   \tMs. Aymee Veiner, 13281 SW 100 Terrace, Miami, Florida 3.   \tMr. Lawrence Percival, President of Greater Kendall Community Activists, 11945 SW 127th Court, Miami, Florida There being no other persons registered or wishing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Addressing comments made by Mr. Winker, Mr. Norwalk commented on the price paid to acquire the subject property and clarified that the Parks and Recreation department supported the application and was working with the developer to create green spaces.  He objected and questioned the validity of statements made by Mr. Winker regarding wetlands jurisdiction and reiterated the applicant was committed to protecting the rookery and any endangered bird and bat species nesting on site. Mr. Norwalk emphasized that 84 percent (84%) of residents with a view of the rookery supported the application and further noted that the subject property in question was not public park space but private property.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s efforts to engage the community and reviewed the terms of the resolved settlement agreement.  Mr. Norwalk pointed out the foregoing application was the result of two years of negotiations with homeowners as to the type of development they wished to see on the property and was not a financial settlement. Ms. Mehta reviewed the definition of ï¿½critical habitatï¿½ as it relates to the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) and clarified the issues identified by DERM, including tree removal, soil and rookery issues, would be handled during the permitting process.  She pointed out the conditions were a part of the application and recognized G.L. Homesï¿½ stellar reputation as builders and developers. Mr. Shane Johnson, Senior Ecologist and Project Manager with environmental consulting firm Passarella & Associates, addressed comments made by Mr. Winker regarding wetlands inventory mapping.  He contended the mapping process did not determine federal jurisdiction and clarified that the subject property was a closed system with no hydrological exchange across the project boundary with no connection to navigable waters.  Mr. Johnson stated the features on the subject property, including the five (5) lakes were isolated and non-jurisdictional. Ms. Mehta noted the applicant accepted all conditions and requested the Board to approve the foregoing application per staffï¿½s recommendation. Responding to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s request for clarification regarding assertions made by Mr. Winker that todayï¿½s (11/17) Zoning meeting was improperly noticed with reference to the foregoing application, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained that the foregoing application was properly advertised prior to the October 20, 2021 Zoning meeting.  He noted the public was informed on October 20, 2021 at the meeting site that the Zoning meeting had been cancelled and staff took additional measures to advise the public of the new meeting date consistent with the process for meetings cancelled due to lack of quorum.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated the County was not required to re-advertise when an item was deferred due to a meeting cancellation as a result of lack of quorum and assured the Board members that all legal requirements for todayï¿½s meeting had been satisfied. Mr. Kogon noted signs were posted on October 20, 2021 explaining that all items on the Zoning agenda would be deferred to the November 17, 2021 Zoning meeting.  He added that courtesy ï¿½mail outsï¿½ were resent to residences within the same radius as the original ï¿½mail outsï¿½ and a notice was posted on the subject property with the new (11/17) meeting date. Additionally, Mr. Kogon pointed out electronic notifications were also sent out to subscribers advising of the new date. Commissioner Regalado noted CDMP Application 20200009 (CDMP Agenda Item 4A) sought to develop between 800 and 1000 residential units on 161.48 acres which was located less than four (4) miles from the foregoing subject property.  She requested clarification regarding the applicantï¿½s request and the density currently permitted on the site. Mr. Kogon advised the Board members that the subject property size was 168 acres.  He explained the current density range under the existing designation for the property would allow between 420 and 1008 units to be built on the subject property; and noted the applicant was requesting to build 550 single-family residential units. Commissioner Regalado inquired about the circumstances surrounding the removal of the covenant and its impact on the foregoing application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained on October 29, 2020, the Board considered an application to release the covenant which restricted use of the subject property to a golf course and county club uses. He noted as a result of releasing the covenant, the subject property designated use defaulted to its underlying zoning category, Interim (GU) and Estate Modified Residential District (EU-M) which permitted approximately 30 homes to be built on the subject property with the option for the applicant to request additional density.  Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the CDMP allowance for a Parks and Recreation designation would allow for residential development compatible with densities in the surrounding areas which would permit approximately 400 to 1000 homes to be built on the subject property. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Assistant County Attorney Kerbel regarding the outcome of litigation between the golf course owner and ï¿½Ring Lotï¿½ homeowners which the County was not privy to. Mr. Lee Hefty, Director, DERM, clarified that the department requested the applicant conduct surveys over several months during the wading birds breeding season to identify the level of utilization of the rookery. Commissioner Regalado asked whether DERM had visited the site and inquired about the presence of endangered bats in the area and DERMï¿½s involvement in protecting the rookery.  She also requested clarification regarding the types of enhancements the applicant would be required to make to protect the existing wildlife. Mr. Hefty confirmed that DERM had conducted an onsite visit and determined there was exotic vegetation which should normally be removed.  He explained DERM would issue an administrative variation to maintain the exotic landscape in the event the trees were being utilized by birds.  Mr. Hefty noted acoustic surveys determined that Florida bonneted bats utilized the area and as such DERM had requested the applicant implement best management practices to preserve utilization for the bats.  He detailed the types of surveys required during the wading bird breeding season and stated based on the results of these surveys, the applicant would be expected to modify development for the rookery area by implementing buffering pursuant to State requirements. Mr. Hefty stated some of the enhancements proposed by DERM to protect the bonneted bats and wading birds included restricted use of pesticides and herbicides and additional tree coverage in the landscaping plans.  He noted DERM also requested minimized use of lighting in areas frequented by the bats for foraging and roosting birds. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Hefty regarding possible residual contaminants in the soil due to the previous use of the property as a golf course and staffï¿½s recommendations regarding preservation of existing wildlife. Mr. Hefty stated the applicant would be required to perform soil analysis in areas earmarked for the storm water retention ponds to determine whether the ponds could be constructed as proposed without exacerbating existing contamination. Commissioner Martinez spoke about the circumstances surrounding the removal of the covenant in 2020 and contended the foregoing application would have a direct impact on commission district 11 due to its location.  He commented on the benefits of the development proposed under CDMP application 20200009 and the foregoing proposed application would not only impact traffic congestion but also quality of life. Commissioner Martinez requested clarification regarding the police departmentï¿½s recommendation that an internal traffic study be performed prior to and post construction and requested Mr. Ron Magill be allowed to readdress the Board regarding his concerns. Mr. Magill urged the Board members to defer the foregoing application so that an independent study could be performed by FWC and Bat Conservation International. Commissioner Martinez stated that while he recognized the quality of homes constructed by the developer he was concerned about the number of homes proposed to be built on the site and recounted his experience as a police officer responding to an emergency in a large residential development and the difficulties associated with finding a residence.  He commented on the discourse and relationship between neighbors supporting and opposing the application and reiterated the proposed development would impact the surrounding communities not just the Calusa neighborhood. Discussion ensued between Chairman Diaz and Commissioner Martinez about recalling speakers. Chairman Diaz reiterated all speakers were provided one (1) minute to address the Board members. Addressing comments made by the police department concerning the foregoing application, Mr. Kogon confirmed that the police department requested an ongoing traffic analysis be performed during the projectï¿½s development.  He noted the proffered covenant agreed to comply with all applicable conditions, requirements, recommendations, requests and other provisions of the Traffic Engineering Division (TED) of the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) as indicated in the memorandum dated August 26, 2021. Commissioner Regalado pointed out the applicant had agreed to fund three (3) additional police officers. Mr. Kogon noted the traffic mitigation plans were detailed on pages 3 through 8 of the declaration of restrictions. Commissioner Heyman stated she could not support the application unless the density was reduced and recounted the history of the subject property. Chairman Diaz requested copies of the notice provided to the public regarding the deferral of the foregoing item to todayï¿½s (11/17) Zoning agenda due to the October 20, 2021 Zoning meeting cancellation. Responding to Chairman Diazï¿½s question about the steps taken to protect the rookery and existing wildlife, Mr. Hefty reiterated DERM recommended the applicant buffer the rookery area pursuant to State requirements and perform surveys during the wading bird nesting season, prior to the issuance of any construction permits. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed the conditions listed by Mr. Hefty were contained in staffï¿½s recommendation for approval. Mr. Norwalk agreed to the conditions recommended by DERM. Commissioner Regalado recognized the sensitivity of the application given the history of the subject property and addressed social media comments regarding the lack of access to the commission on the foregoing application, explaining the Jennings Rule prohibited Board members from speaking to the public regarding Zoning applications. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Norwalk regarding the use of palm trees for landscaping. Mr. Norwalk referenced the conditions of the settlement agreement and stated he would make a best effort commitment to limit the use of palm trees in the landscaping plans. Commissioner Regalado noted the foregoing application and CDMP application 20200009 were both located in the same park district, which reported an excess 346.01 acres of land and questioned whether the park impact fees generated by the foregoing proposed development could be allocated to fund improvements at the Kendall Indian Hammocks Trail and the West Kendall Trail. Mr. Alejandro Zizold , Master Plan Manager, Miami-Dade Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces (PROS), reviewed the criteria for allocating park impact fees and assured the Board members if the trails identified by Commissioner Regalado were located close to the proposed development, staff would explore the possibility of allocating the fees to improve/develop the trails.  He noted the applicant was amenable to investing the improvement impact fees to park development in lieu of payment of the fees. Commissioner Regalado inquired about the mechanism for allocating park impact fees to fund improvements at the Kendall Indian Hammocks Trail and the West Kendall Trail. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained the allocation could be made a part of the approval, directing the applicant to work with the parks department to ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, that the park impact fees be used for the two trails. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Cecil regarding the settlement agreement and buffering requirements between residential units. Commissioner Regalado indicated her intent that the full amount of the park impact fees (approximately $1.5 million) be evenly allocated to fund improvements at the Kendall Indian Hammocks Trail and the West Kendall Trail, to the maximum extent feasible, including landscaping, pedestrian and bike access. Commissioner Regalado voiced her support for the foregoing application and upon the conclusion of extensive discussions on the foregoing application, moved to approve the application per staff recommendation with an amendment to require the Park Impact fees be evenly allocated to fund improvements at the Kendall Indian Hammocks Trail and the West Kendall Trail, to the maximum extent feasible. Commissioner Regalado requested staff provide additional information regarding the status of the rookery. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted one of the conditions of the applicationï¿½s approval required ongoing monitoring of the rookery and assured the Board members that updates would be forthcoming. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application with conditions, per staff recommendation and the amendment to address the impact fees. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-34-21. 10/20/2021 Carried over by the Zoning Board 1C 212538 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2021000083  --  DISTRICT: 02  --  APPLICANT: EVANGEL CHURCH INTERNATIONAL, INC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS TO PERMIT A REZONING OF THE SUBJECT PARCEL FROM EU-S, ESTATE USE SUBURBAN DISTRICT, TO RU-4, HIGH DENSITY APARTMENT HOUSE DISTRICT.

McGhee Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Gilbert, III , Monestime REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Mr. Juan Mayol, Holland & Knight, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida appeared on behalf of the applicant, 216 Corner LLC. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and noted there were ten (10) speakers registered to speak in support of the item and three (3) speakers registered in opposition of the application. Mr. Mayol asked the speakers registered to speak in support of the foregoing application to stand. Several members of the public waved in support of the item, in lieu of addressing the Board. The following individuals appeared before the Board in opposition of the item: 1.   \tMr. Tallman Whitler, 12811 SW 218th Terrace, Miami, Florida, contended the subject property was not well suited for a school citing traffic and safety concerns. 2.   \tMs. Mary Waters, 13600 SW 229th Street, Miami, Florida, echoed similar concerns as voiced by Mr. Whitler.  She noted a previous application was denied by the Board on October 2018, and requested the foregoing application also be denied.  Ms. Waters argued the subject property was located too close to the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) line and stores selling nicotine and alcoholic products. There being no other persons registered or appearing to speak, Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing. Commissioner Sosa indicated her support for the foregoing application.  She spoke about the benefits of building schools closer to residential areas and contended a schoolï¿½s location was not predicated on its proximity to commercial stores selling alcohol and nicotine. Responding to Chairman Diazï¿½s question as to whether the application had been thoroughly vetted by staff and the administration, Mr. Kogon assured the Board of County Commissionersï¿½ (BCC/Board) members that all the necessary departments and agencies had reviewed and approved the application without objections.  He noted the application met the necessary levels of service for traffic and pointed out that the schoolï¿½s site plan exceeded the circulation requirements. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Heyman and Mr. Kogon about the Boardï¿½s requirement that a School Board representative either be present, and/or provide input regarding the School Boardï¿½s position on pending zoning applications. Mr. Kogon explained there were no reports or evaluations performed for Charter School applications. Addressing comments made by Ms. Waters regarding the location of the subject property, Commissioner Heyman noted the subject parcel was located within the UDB and indicated her support for the application.  She requested future Charter School applications be evaluated by staff and a report provided to the Board; and asked the County Attorneyï¿½s Office to model the Charter School report requirement after the public school legislation previously adopted by the Board. Mr. Kogon stated staff would provide the analysis and report, as permitted by the County Code. Commissioner Regalado noted that she was listening to todayï¿½s (1/20) proceedings prior to her arrival on the dais.  She commented on the need for more schools as the population continued to grow; and stated that while there was currently no mechanism in place to retrieve data for private schools, the report requested by Commissioner Heyman could be processed through the School Boardï¿½s Concurrency Department.  Commissioner Regalado pointed out that Charter Schools were not bound by concurrency requirements and noted geography and placements were determined by the County or municipality overseeing the zoning process. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell advised the Board members that the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resourcesï¿½ (DERM) memorandum distributed earlier today (1/20), contained a typographical error with regards to the date, and clarified that the correct date should read ï¿½January 6, 2022ï¿½ as listed in Condition 17 of the Staff Report to the Board of County Commissioners. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, per staff recommendation.  The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-1-22. 3C 220093 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2021000162  --  DISTRICT(S): 03 AND 05   --  APPLICANT: MIAMI SUPERTOWER A, LLC, AND MIAMI SUPERTOWER B, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICATION IS TO PERMIT A MODIFICATION OF A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE DOWNTOWN INTERMODAL DISTRICT (DID) CORRIDOR SUBZONE OF THE FIXED GUIDEWAY RAPID TRANSIT ZONE (RTZ). ADDITIONALLY, THE APPLICATION SEEKS APPROVAL OF THE EXPANSION OF THE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS ON TO ADDITIONAL PROPERTY, ALONG WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED HOTEL USES, AND THE SIMULTANEOUS DECREASE OF OFFICE USES AND INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL USES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.  --  LOCATION: LYING WEST OF NW 1ST AVENUE, BETWEEN NW 1ST ST AND NW 3RD STREET, AKA, 220 NW 1 AVENUE AND 195 NW 2 STREET, CITY OF MIAMI, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved with conditions Zoning Z-2-22 Mover: Eileen Higgins Seconder: Rebeca Sosa Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: Gilbert, III , Monestime REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed.  He advised the Board members that a new zoning application kit with updated staff memorandums was provided to the Board members along with todayï¿½s (1/20) zoning agenda.  Mr. Kogon clarified that while the subject property was located in commission district 5, it was also a part of the Intermodal Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ) which spanned commission districts 3 and 5. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and; there being no speakers registered or appearing before the Board on the foregoing application, closed the public hearing. Commissioner Higgins reiterated the subject property was completely situated in commission district 5.  She waived the full presentation by the applicant since she was already fully apprised on the application, and reviewed the intent of the foregoing item. Commissioner Higgins stated that while she recognized the applicantï¿½s efforts to increase the housing component of the project, she was concerned about the ï¿½back of the houseï¿½ design aesthetics for the proposed development and the terms of the City of Miamiï¿½s parking requirements currently incorporated in staffï¿½s recommendation for approval. Mr. Javier Avino, Bilzin Sumberg, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, appeared on behalf of the applicants Miami Supertower A, LLC., and Miami Supertower B, LLC.  He spoke about the challenges associated with building a development of scope on the subject property and noted the applicantï¿½s commitment to maintaining the design aesthetic provided it did not impede parking or access to the building. Addressing Commissioner Higginsï¿½ concerns regarding the City of Miamiï¿½s parking requirement recommendations which were incorporated in staffï¿½s recommendation for approval, Mr. Kogon explained the applicant could commit to provide a minimum number of parking spaces at todayï¿½s meeting, which would then be incorporated as a condition of approval. Mr. Avino explained the applicant was not in a position at this time to commit to a specific number of parking spaces, however the applicant was prepared to comply with the Countyï¿½s parking requirements.  He pointed out that the City of Miamiï¿½s parking recommendations were put forth as requests for consideration and did not obligate the applicant to provide reduced parking. Commissioner Higgins clarified her concern stemmed from the Countyï¿½s memorandum which included the City of Miamiï¿½s parking recommendation as a condition. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell read into the record the current condition for approval number two as outlined in the staff recommendation, which included the City of Miamiï¿½s comments. Mr. Avino assured the Board members that the applicant was amenable to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request that they work with the County to determine the appropriate number of parking spaces for the development, given the projectï¿½s proximity to Government Center.   He also pointed out that the applicationï¿½s existing language specified that parking would comply with Miami-Dade County Code (County Code/Code) Section 33-124(C) (9). Commissioner Higgins voiced her concerns regarding the lack of public green space and noted a small park was eliminated to accommodate the proposed development and ensuing infrastructural improvements.  She requested the applicant explore options for creating an alternative public green space for the area. Mr. Avino clarified the land swap referenced by Commissioner Higgins allowed for the realignment of NW 1st Avenue and provided an even larger property to the City of Miami.  He stated the applicant would comply with the Countyï¿½s Code which required the developer to allocate a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the area to open space, and spoke about the applicantï¿½s plans to activate the pedestrian element of the projectï¿½s design to create the desired open space. Commissioner Higgins maintained that open space was not necessarily the same as public green space. Mr. Avino identified an area abutting the metro-rail which provided the applicant an opportunity to collaborate with the City of Miami to add landscaping and greenery. Referencing the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) memorandum, Commissioner Higgins commented on the projectï¿½s lack of ï¿½niceï¿½ connectivity to the Metro-rail and Metro-mover systems, and noted there was also no accommodations for cyclists, all of which needed to be addressed.  She requested all micro-mobility options be docked as a condition of the applicationï¿½s approval. Commissioner Higgins addressed the projectsï¿½ traffic and transit flow issues, and requested the development's design include a dedicated area for valet and ride sharing services which would not impede public traffic and/or roadways.  She also requested clarification regarding the developmentï¿½s plans for truck access, specifically along NW 2nd Street. Mr. Avino assured the Board members that the applicant was prepared to coordinate with County staff and the traffic consultants during the final stages of the developmentï¿½s design to determine the appropriate area for valet and ride sharing facilities.  He also noted that the applicant was amenable to ensuring all micro-mobility options be docked as requested by Commissioner Higgins. Addressing Commissioner Higginsï¿½ question regarding truck access, Mr. Avino clarified that while the ï¿½preconceptualï¿½ plans identified the main circulation point along NW 2nd Street, additional limited loading exit points along NW 1st Street and NW 3rd Street were also being considered to minimize traffic congestion on NW 2nd Avenue. Commissioner Higgins requested the applicant commit to a condition which would require all valet, food delivery and ride sharing facilities be incorporated in the projectï¿½s design and not occur at street level. Mr. Avino agreed to the condition as stated by Commissioner Higgins, on the applicantï¿½s behalf. Commissioner Higgins spoke to the need for additional Metro-rail and Metro-mover access along NW 3rd Street.  She voiced her concerns about on-street parking along NW 1st Street and questioned whether a dedicated bus lane had been considered. Ms. Claudia Diaz, Traffic Engineering Division Chief, DTPW, stated no plans for a dedicated bus lane had been submitted to date, but noted staff could provide comments during the Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR) process. Commissioner Higgins questioned whether there was a mechanism in place during the Zoning process which would allow the Board to require all the traffic signals be upgraded by the applicant for transit system prioritization. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell explained that while it could be considered a defensible condition if it were related to the impacts of the proposed development, she would defer to DTPW to make the final recommendation. Commissioner Higgins stated that while she recognized the merits of the proposed development, she remained concerned about the traffic and transit flow issues.  She urged the applicant to meet with DTPW so that all transit departments (bus and rail) could develop a plan to improve pedestrian and rail connectivity, in addition to addressing the departments concerns regarding NW 2nd Street. Mr. Avino noted that several traffic issues, such as the traffic signalization component, had been addressed during the ï¿½re-platï¿½ process. Commissioner Higgins voiced her concerns regarding the lack of communication between County departments citing the differences in the Transit and Traffic memorandums. She requested all parties involved meet to develop a comprehensive plan in time for the February Zoning meeting. Returning to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ concerns regarding the ï¿½back of the houseï¿½ design and functionality, Mr. Kogon pointed out that the County Code governing the Downtown Intermodal District (DID) addressed architectural expression and recommended the following language be incorporated as a condition for approval: ï¿½All buildingsï¿½ facades facing public or private streets ï¿½rights of wayï¿½, or public open spaces, including portions of the building that abut the Government Center Plaza and entranceways to the Government Center, shall be treated with consistent architectural expression.  Such wall areas that abut the Metro-rail shall use a combination of glazing, landscaping and artistic expression, such as sculptures, mosaics and similar features.ï¿½ Mr. Kogon also suggested an additional condition be imposed which would require the applicant to connect the building situated on Lot 2 to the existing bridge which currently connected the Brightline Station to the Government Center Metro-rail and Metro-mover Station. Mr. Avino advised the Board members that while the applicant did not oppose to increasing connectivity between the Brightline Station and the Government Center Metro-rail/metro mover Station, he would request additional time to explore all options since the bridge was not a part of the applicantï¿½s original plans. Commissioner Higgins reiterated her concerns regarding the transit connectivity issues and suggested deferring the application to the February 17, 2022 Zoning meeting to work out the details. In response to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request for additional conditional language to address concerns related to the applicationï¿½s parking and public green space plans, Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell read the following proposed conditions into the record: ~   \tTo strike the parking recommendations detailed in the City of Miamiï¿½s memorandum and allow the applicant to provide the appropriate amount of parking; ~   \tTo require the applicant to provide plans and/or address how they intend to mitigate the loss of open space in and around the proposed development; ~   \tTo require the applicant to ensure the safe movement and access by pedestrians and cyclists would not be impeded or precluded due to increased traffic created along 2nd Street, by facilitating  access and movement across all streets; ~   \tTo require all micro-mobility equipment to be docked; ~   \tTo prohibit ride-sharing (Uber and/or Lyft), valet or delivery services on the public streets, and require the applicant to ensure such activities occur under the structure or in a driveway away from pubic streets; and ~   \tTo require the applicant to revisit the buildingï¿½s design regarding access to 2nd Street. Commissioner Higgins advocated for the deferral of the application to allow the applicant additional time to properly plan and thus avoid traffic disruption. Commissioner Sosa recognized the merits of the proposed development and expressed her concerns about the additional conditions of approval proffered and the undue burden it may place on the applicant. Commissioner Heyman voiced her support for the application and echoed the concerns raised by Commissioner Sosa regarding the additional conditions for approval. Commissioner Higgins argued this was the last time the application would be considered by the Board therefore a thorough review was needed. Commissioner Heyman contended many of the issues addressed in the conditions proffered by Commissioner Higgins were routinely addressed in the Countyï¿½s Code and through the ASPR process.  She reiterated her concerns about micromanaging the project given the scope and maintained that oversight should remain with staff. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Heyman and Mr. Avino regarding the cost of the project. Commissioner McGhee indicated his support for the application.  He concurred that the additional conditions could be viewed as unnecessary micromanaging and pointed out the Countyï¿½s Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Department (PROS) also supported the application. Commissioner Garcia stated that he also shared Commissioner Higginsï¿½ concerns regarding parking and traffic flow for the area.  He commented on the need for additional affordable/workforce housing units and requested clarification regarding the type of units being developed and the applicantï¿½s parking plans. Mr. Avino reviewed the intent of the application and noted the project would add 2007 market rate residential units.  He pointed out that the proposed development was subject to the Countyï¿½s parking requirements and despite there being no minimum requirement for parking, the applicant proposed building 2139 parking spaces to cover residential and commercial needs.  Mr. Avino emphasized the parking capacity was subject to revision and change during the ASPR process and also noted the proposed project would generate less traffic trips than the previously envisioned project. Commissioner Garcia concurred with Commissioner Higginsï¿½ stance that issues should be resolved prior to the applicationï¿½s final approval. Commissioner Regalado questioned whether the parking places would be equipped with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Mr. Avino assured the Board members that the proposed development would comply with all Countyï¿½s requirements including but not limited to EV parking spots. Revisiting the public green space concerns, Commissioner Regalado pointed out that trails and greenways were also considered open spaces and recommended the applicant consider enhancing the walkways and pedestrian access in and around the proposed development.  She urged the applicant to utilize alternative landscaping trees in lieu of palm trees. Mr. Avino reiterated the applicantï¿½s willingness to work with the County to enhance the area and improve connectivity.  He spoke about the applicantï¿½s plans to ensure the final project design seamlessly blended pedestrian and vehicular activity. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Hardemon and Mr. Avino regarding the public benefits component of the application and the land swap agreement with the City of Miami. Commissioner Hardemon stated affordable/workforce housing units were traditionally only constructed in specific communities and contended more affordable and workforce housing was needed in the urban core.  He commented on the process for making requests of developers to construct workforce housing/affordable housing units and indicated his intent to consult with the County Attorneyï¿½s Office to draft legislation which would provide financial aid or credits through reduced property taxes for public servants. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated she would support the district commissionersï¿½ decision. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Martinez and Mr. Kogon regarding the parking capacity at the proposed development and possible ways of measuring the success of other developments with reduced parking capacity. Mr. Kogon explained that an incorrect addendum was included in the zoning kit and clarified that Intermodal sub-districts did not require parking spaces for residential units.  He pointed out the applicant, in addition to the commercial and retail parking spaces, had agreed to provide residential parking despite the Countyï¿½s parking requirements for the area. Commissioner Martinez reiterated his concerns regarding the lack of parking spaces in urban areas. Mr. Kogon reviewed the existing parking requirements for urban areas and pointed out most developers were not taking advantage of parking reductions offered under the County Code. Commissioner Regalado proffered her personal transit experience as a Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ) resident. Commissioner Martinez contended every resident experience was different and reiterated his intent to meet with staff to review the success of reduced parking in RTZs. Chairman Diaz spoke to the merits of the application and voiced his concerns about setting a precedent regarding the micromanaging of projects. Commissioner McGhee noted the application impacted commission districts 3 and 5 and questioned whether Commissioner Hardemon had considered geofencing impact fees to benefit residents. Commissioner Hardemon recognized Commissioner Higginsï¿½ leadership to the advancement of the proposed project and stated he would continue to defer to her decisions regarding the application. Commissioner Higgins acknowledged the concerns raised by her colleagues regarding the proffered conditions and pointed out the applicant had agreed to all but one of the conditions.  She clarified her position regarding the parking requirements and reiterated her intent for the applicant to provide the appropriate number of parking spaces consistent with the Countyï¿½s requirements. Mr. Avino explained the proposed development would construct 2007 residential units and provide a minimum of 2139 parking spaces.  He noted there was already 816 residential units built to date with parking provided for those units. Discussion ensued among Commissioner Higgins, Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell, Mr. Kogon and Mr. Avino regarding the special condition related to parking. Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell noted the amendment proffered by Commissioner Higgins would modify the Countyï¿½s Condition No. 2 to the extent that it refers to the City of Miamiï¿½s recommendation to provide reduced parking. Mr. Kogon recommended the applicant complete and submit a parking study based upon Urban Land Institute (ULI) methodology. Mr. Avino stated the applicant would be amenable to striking the parking condition as detailed in the City of Miamiï¿½s recommendation memorandum, and providing the parking study as outlined by Mr. Kogon. Commissioner Higgins reiterated her concerns regarding the street layout along NW 1st Street and questioned what mechanisms were in place to allow the application to advance with the condition that the applicant must meet with DTPW, RER and herself to develop a plan to minimize bus service interruptions. Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell cautioned against such a meeting citing potential conflict with appealable decisions. Commissioner Higgins stated she needed additional information from DTPW and emphasized the importance of the meeting. Mr. Avino stated that while the applicant was amenable to meeting with County staff and Commissioner Higgins to discuss the street layout issue, the final decision on whether there should be on-street parking or a dedicated bus lane remained with the County. Commissioner Higgins explained her urgency to resolve the issues were based on the fact that the property would be sold and this was the last opportunity to ensure all concerns were addressed. Mr. Avino introduced Ms. Iris Escarra, Greenberg Traurig LLP., as the applicantï¿½s local representative and assured the Board members that the applicant was bound by the proffered covenant and other obligations tied to the subject property. Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell explained in the event the foregoing application was approved by the Board, the application would proceed to the ASPR stage and reviewed publicly by the Rapid Transit Developmental Impact Committee (RTDIC). Discussion ensued among Chairman Diaz, Commissioner Higgins and Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell regarding Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request to be involved in the meetings between the applicant and DTPW staff to ensure the issues addressed at todayï¿½s (1/20) meeting were resolved per the Boardï¿½s intent. In light of Commissioner Higginsï¿½ reservations about the street layout and its impact on buses and parking, Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer Raurell stated that it would be appropriate to include a special condition of approval which required the applicant to meet with County staff to address the district commissionersï¿½ concerns. Mr. Avino announced that the applicant accepted all, but one of the conditions proffered by Commissioner Higgins.  He stated that while the applicant was not prepared to commit to connecting the building situated on Lot 2 to the existing bridge which currently linked the Brightline Station to the Metro-rail Station, the applicant was committed to exploring the possibility along with alternative solutions. Upon the conclusion of extensive discussions on the foregoing application, Commissioner Higgins moved to approve the application, per staff recommendation, including the following additional conditions: ~   \tTo strike the parking recommendations detailed in the City of Miamiï¿½s memorandum and allow the applicant to provide the appropriate amount of parking; ~   \tTo require the applicant to complete and submit a parking study based upon Urban Land Institute (ULI) methodology; ~   \tTo require all buildingsï¿½ facades facing public or private streets ï¿½rights of wayï¿½, or public open spaces, including portions of the building that abut the Government Center Plaza and entranceways to the Government Center, shall be treated with consistent architectural expression.  Such wall areas that abut the Metro-rail shall use a combination of glazing, landscaping and artistic expression, such as sculptures, mosaics and similar features; ~   \tTo require the applicant to explore the possibility of connecting the building situated on Lot 2 to the existing bridge which currently connected the Brightline Station to the Metro-rail Station; ~   \tTo require the applicant to provide plans and/or address how they intend to mitigate the loss of open space in and around the proposed development; ~   \tTo require the applicant to ensure the safe movement and access by pedestrians and cyclists would not be impeded or precluded due to increased traffic created along 2nd Street, by facilitating  access and movement across all streets; ~   \tTo require all micro-mobility equipment to be docked; ~   \tTo prohibit ride-sharing (Uber and/or Lyft), valet or delivery services on the public streets, and require the applicant to ensure such activities occur under the structure or in a driveway away from pubic streets; ~   \tTo require the applicant to revisit the buildingï¿½s design regarding access to 2nd Street; ~   \tTo require the applicant to meet with staff and the various County departments to address concerns related to buses, traffic, parking, design layout, connectivity, pedestrians and cyclist access and safety. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, per staff recommendation, and the aforementioned additional conditions. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-2-22. ADJOURNMENT REPORT: All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s (1/20) meeting were transferred to the care, custody, and control of the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER).

He noted County staff recommended approval of the application.

Consequently, the applicant addressed some of those concerns and provided relief. He made a PowerPoint presentation to explain the planned development of the property.

Upon conclusion of the discussion, the Board members proceeded to vote on this application as recommended by County staff to approve Requests #1 through #12 with conditions, including the added conditions proffered by the applicantï¿½s attorney. Commissioner Monestime voiced his support for the application. In response to Commissioner Hardemonï¿½s relating to earlier imposed covenants, Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel responded he was not aware of any covenant violations or modification requests. Commissioner Hardemon advised the student population was increased by fifty percent (50%); therefore, he was troubled by this fact and the traffic impact on the surrounding area. Commissioner Cohen Higgins expressed her concerns about the traffic increase. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Mr. Kogon regarding the traffic impact arising from the increased student population and the school acreage. Commissioner Cohen Higgins voiced her support for the schoolï¿½s request for growth and the staffï¿½s recommendation. She noted the schoolï¿½s request was reasonable since they had not requested an increase in the student population in 20 years. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Arza regarding the schoolï¿½s operating hours, pickup and drop-off hours, and traffic-related issues.

Mr. Graham Penn, counsel for the applicant, Law Offices of Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin Tapanes, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, appeared before the Board and apprised the Board that the County staff had added a condition to the list. He noted the applicant had no objections to the condition added. Mr. Penn advised the project lender, Freddie Mac, had requested a technical change be made to the covenant to make it consistent with the Workforce Program. He noted the covenant would have the additional requirement at the time of signature. He explained this project had importance to the County because it was an elderly housing project. Mr. Kogon advised condition #8 was added to the covenant, which required the applicant to comply with the applicable conditions required from the Traffic Engineering Division memorandum dated April 16, 2021. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing; and hearing no one that wished to speak, the public hearing was closed. Hearing no other comments or objections, the Board members proceeded to take a vote to approve the application per the staffï¿½s recommendations as follows: 1.  \tApproval of request #1 subject to the Boardï¿½s acceptance of the proffered covenant; and 2.  \tApproval with conditions of request #2; 3.  \tTo add condition #8 requiring the applicant to comply with the applicable conditions required from the Traffic Engineering Division memorandum dated April 16, 2021; and 4.  \tTo require a technical change be made to the covenant to make it consistent with the Workforce Program as required by Freddie Mac.

Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing. Mr. Sergio Concepcion, 4300 Santa Maria Street, Coral Gables, Florida, appeared before the Board and noted the applicantï¿½s counsel would make the presentation. Mr. Ryan Bailine, counsel for the applicant, 333 SE Second Street, Miami, Florida, in conjunction with Ms. Nicole Wolfe, appeared before the Board to make a PowerPoint presentation. He explained the intent of the applicant was to request the subject property be re-designated from Mixed-Use Corridor (MC) to Mixed-Use Corridor Special (MCS) and that the line be moved to develop a car wash facility. Mr. Bailine summarized the background history of the propertyï¿½s designation, the charade, and the reasons for the applicantï¿½s request. He explained that, once the zoning application was approved, the applicant would apply for an administrative review process. He also advised that the applicant submitted a covenant stating that the property would not be used for any of the other uses and would move forward as quickly as possible to submit a site plan to develop the proposed car wash on this property. Mr. Bailine advised an Opinion of Title was submitted, and it was current with no changes. He stated the investment on this property that had been vacant for several years was over $1.5 million. He advised it would create eighteen to twenty (18-20) temporary jobs during its construction period and create between twelve to fifteen (12-15) jobs when completed. He noted two (2) of those jobs would be designated management positions earning annual salaries between $55,000 to $60,000; and the remaining balance of the employees, which was between ten to twelve (10-12) jobs, would earn annually between $25,000 to $35,000. He explained the applicationï¿½s economic impact and how it would generate ad valorem taxes for the County. Pursuant to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question regarding the Countyï¿½s position on this application, Mr. Kogon advised the staff recommended denial even though it was consistent with other uses within that area. He explained that the community urban center policies, primarily LU-7, directed them to review land uses that were consistent with transit-oriented development projects. Therefore, staff recommended denial of the application since it was a car wash-related project. In response to Commissioner Monestimeï¿½s question, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that the CDMP policies discouraged automotive-related uses in urban center designated areas. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Monestime and Mr. Kogon regarding the applicationï¿½s compatibility in accordance with the CDMP. Upon conclusion of this discussion, the Board members proceeded to vote on this application to approve the denial of the application without prejudice as recommended by staff. The Board subsequently adopted this application, set forth in the Record of Resolutions, and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-6-22. 2/17/2022 Carried over by the Zoning Board CURRENT ITEMS 3A 220572 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2021000229  --  DISTRICT: 02  --  APPLICANT:  NARANJA 4, LLC  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S):  THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING PERMIT A CHANGE OF THE SUB-DISTRICT REGULATING MAP FOR THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM CORE AND CENTER SUB-DISTRICT TO CENTER SUB-DISTRICT, WITHIN THE NARANJA COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (NCUCD).  --  LOCATION: LYING NORTHEASTERLY OF SW 146 COURT, BETWEEN S.

Commissioner McGhee advised this application offered to develop a drive-through restaurant, retailed facilities, and other amenities and facilities that would benefit the residents of the surrounding area after the approval of this application and the administrative site plan review. Commissioner McGhee voiced his support for the application and asked for the Board membersï¿½ support. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing; and hearing no one that wished to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Kogon announced the originally advertised application contained a scrivenerï¿½s error that showed the property as part of County Commission District 2, but the application was revised to reflect that the property was located within County Commission District 9. Ms. Vanessa Madrid, Law Offices of Holland & Knight, appeared before the Board to thank Commissioner McGhee and staff for supporting the application. She advised the application would provide the type of development desired by the Board along transit corridors. She noted the property had been vacant for decades, and the project would promote transit ridership and revitalize the surrounding area if approved. Hearing no other comments or objections, the Board members proceeded to take a vote to approve this application as recommended by staff. The Board subsequently adopted this application, set forth in the Record of Resolutions, and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-7-22.

Chairman Diaz asked supporters for the application to stand up and demonstrate visible support for the application in lieu of speaking. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared in opposition to the foregoing application: - Mr. Vincent Chan, 10885 SW 95 Street, Miami, Florida; - Mr. Elias Artze, 10770 SW 95 Street, Miami, Florida; - Mr. Guy Gladson, 10795 SW 95 Street, Miami, Florida; and - Mr. Jeovanni Tarafa, 10751 SW 96 Terrace, Miami, Florida. The following person came forward to speak in support of the application: -Ms. Michelle Sukert, 8400 SW 180 Street, Palmetto Bay, Florida. Mr. Juan Mayol, an attorney representing the applicant, Christian Investment Holding, LLC, gave a PowerPoint presentation.  He discussed the applicantï¿½s request to increase the grades for Our Lady of the Rosary School from Pre-K to 5 to Pre-K to 8, and to increase the enrollment from 150 to 250 children.  Mr. Mayol stated the proposed expansion would occur to the west of the existing school and the proposed new classroom building would remain residential in character. Mr. Mayol stated the subject property was zoned for agricultural use (AU), but was designated for low-density residential.  He noted part of the applicantï¿½s request was to rezone from AU to Single Family Estate Modified Use (EU-M); however, the Board would not be required to approve the rezoning to approve the expansion in grades and the number of students.  Mr. Mayol advised the application was consistent with the Comprehensive Development Master Planï¿½s goals, policies and objectives and the applicant had tried to address the neighborsï¿½ concerns.  He noted the applicant had agreed to redesign the traffic operations plan and had submitted several revisions into the record to RER staff, which addressed concerns raised by residents regarding school operations, traffic, buffers and noise. Mr. Mayol stated the applicant could not agree to the neighborsï¿½ request for a traffic signal as it would cost approximately $450,000 to install a traffic signal on SW 107 Avenue and SW 95 Street, and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) had advised they would not approve the installation of a traffic signal because it did not comply with the spacing requirements.  He noted that all traffic to or from the school would enter and exit through SW 107 Avenue, and only emergency vehicles would be allowed access through SW 95 Street.  He pointed out the traffic study conducted indicated the site plan exceeded the required drop off/dismissal spaces. Mr. Mayol noted various departments were in support of the application and he stated that pursuant to the Division of Environmental Resources Managementï¿½s (DERM) request, the applicant provided a covenant promising to connect the school to the public sewer system, and was working with DERM to provide a joinder. Mr. Mayol introduced Mr. Josï¿½ Cossio, Administrator for Our Lady of the Rosary school, who commented on the schoolï¿½s mission, curriculum and the scholarships they provided. In conclusion, Mr. Mayol stated the applicant accepted the conditions proposed by staff.  He noted staff recommended approval of the entire application; however, the Board could choose not to approve the rezoning to EU-M, and approve the balance of the requests, which would result in an increase in the school area and the number of students and grade levels. Commissioner Regalado expressed concerns regarding the one-way street and asked whether the homeowners agreed with closing the one-way street. She noted that the transcript, as it was presented in the Community Council, was different from what was before the Board. Mr. Mayol stated the one-way street was not adjacent to the school and the applicant was proposing to reroute traffic from SW 95 Street to SW 107 Avenue. In response to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s inquiry whether the only disagreement  the neighbors  was with the traffic signal on SW 107 Avenue, Mr. Tarafa confirmed this contention and added that increasing the student population would adversely impact traffic.  He commented on the traffic delays that occurred on SW 95 Street, which prevented emergency services from entering his neighborhood. 1:05 He noted that since many schools were located on SW 107 Avenue, parents who arrived early to pick up their children, queued along SW 107 Avenue and caused only one lane to be accessible for emergency services. Mr. Mayol rebutted Mr. Tarafaï¿½s comments, and noted the applicant had proposed to reroute the traffic on SW 95 Street to SW 107 Avenue.  He reiterated that it was expensive to install the traffic signal and FDOT would not approve the installation; however, the County could consider building a right turn lane to permit the flow of traffic southbound. Commissioner Regalado inquired whether she could speak with FDOT regarding this issue if she requested the foregoing application be deferred. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised Commissioner Regalado to ask staff to speak with FDOT and return to the Board with the information. Commissioner Regalado asked Mr. Kogon to research Mr. Mayolï¿½s suggestion regarding a right turn lane, and to speak with FDOT regarding the traffic signal or an alternative to the traffic signal. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted staff had enough direction to contact FDOT and because this was a County road, the Miami-Dade Department of Transportation and Public Works had to provide a report when this item came back before the Board. Mr. Mayol clarified that the traffic lined up on SW 107 Avenue related to all schools located on SW 107 Avenue, and not only for the subject school. Mr. Artze commented that SW 95 Street was used as an alternate route by drivers to avoid traffic on SW 88 Street. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed with Chairman Diaz that the public hearing was closed for the application. There being no further discussion, the Board proceeded to defer the foregoing proposed application to the November 16, 2022 Zoning meeting. 9/24/2020 Deferred by the Zoning Board 12/17/2020 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1B 221100 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2019000238  --  DISTRICT(S): 09   --  APPLICANT: TRUE INVESTOR, LLC & VISIONARY INVESTOR, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANTS ARE REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT OF THE GOULDS COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (GCUCD) LAND USE REGULATING PLAN, TO RE-DESIGNATE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM RESIDENTIAL (R), TO RESIDENTIAL MODIFIED (RM), WITHIN THE EDGE SUB-DISTRICT, AND TO PERMIT THE PROPOSED MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT WITH A REDUCED LANDSCAPED STRIP ALONG THE NORTH PROPERTY LINE, TO PERMIT LESS PARKING THAN REQUIRED AND TO PERMIT THE PROPOSED BUILDING TO BE LOCATED CLOSER TO THE REAR PROPERTY LINE THAN PERMITTED.  --  LOCATION: LOCATED LYING SOUTH OF SW 213 STREET AND EAST OF SW 119 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t December 8, 2022 Zoning Z-14-23 Mover: Kionne L.

Approved with conditions Zoning Z-17-22 Mover: Eileen Higgins Seconder: Raquel A. Regalado Vote: 7 - 2 No: Heyman , Cohen Higgins Absent: Monestime , Sosa , Souto REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Department, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 112 protests and nine waivers filed. Discussion ensued among the Board members regarding deferring the application because Chairman Diaz indicated that some Board members were leaving soon and he was concerned that quorum would be lost. Commissioner Heyman suggested that from the group of people who were  in opposition to the application, only two representatives and their counselors come forward to  speak. Mr. Juan Mayol, an attorney who represented BH Aventura Golf Club, countered that he needed more time to present his clientï¿½s case. After several commissioners indicated they would remain at the meeting, which ensured quorum would remain, Chairman Diaz allowed the proceeding to continue. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel explained the Countyï¿½s process regarding administrative review of vested rights and takings claims, which was invoked by objectors of the application. The objectors were late with their invocation, but the Board had discretion to give them additional time to go through the process. He detailed the different options the Board had, which included deferring the application after the public hearing ended or voting on it. Vice Chairman Gilbert III recommended voting on the application after the public hearing rather than deferring it. Mr. Tony Recio, an attorney representing the objectors, which included the Presidential Estates Homeowners Association and unit owners at the property, stated for the record that the invocation of the vested rights was a protective measure and had no effect on the substantive application. He also noted that he and his clients were not requesting a deferral of the application, but for its hearing to proceed. Chairman Diaz noted that equal time would be given to both parties to present their case, and that two persons from each party would be allowed to speak. Mr. Mayol requested the application be deferred to the October 20, 2022 Zoning meeting as a precaution if quorum was not met. Chairman Diaz assured Mr. Mayol that there was quorum in todayï¿½s (9/22) meeting. Chairman Diaz opened the public hearing and the following persons appeared in opposition to the foregoing application: -Ms. Cherise Metz, 19470 Ambassador Court, Miami, Florida; and -Mr. Bob Weisblun, 1800 NE 196 Terrace, Miami, Florida, distributed material, as well. Mr. Mayol gave a PowerPoint presentation about the property listed in the application, and development plans for single-family homes and facilities in the propertyï¿½s former golf course. 1:49 He pointed out that the amount of planned homes was reduced from 134 to 119, which preserved 75 acres of the former golf course. He added the reduction of homes was part of a new plan filed by the applicant. He also spoke about previous applications for the site and noted there were many Presidential Estates owners who supported the application. Mr. Mayol mentioned that the application was vetted and accepted by several County departments, including the Miami-Dade County Planning & Zoning Department (Zoning Department), which determined the application was consistent with original and supplemental declarations for the site. Mr. Mayol emphasized that his client would not build a golf course on the property, though the application included a 5,400-yard golf course layout plan that could be used for bicycle paths, jogging paths or open spaces. Mr. Mayol reported that after consulting with the community, the applicant developed a declaration of restrictions to address concerns from the community. Mr. Mayol asked the Board to approve the application, per staff recommendation after his presentation concluded. Mr. Recio, spoke on behalf of Presidential Estates, and homeowners Lynn and Roberto Elovic, Michel Cohen, and Sergio Rok. Mr. Recio noted that in the comprehensive plan, consent from neighbors was required when attempting to modify a golf course or open space site for another use, no consents were submitted in the application, and the neighborhood had restricted covenants. He distributed printed materials for the record, which included opposition letters. Mr. Recio gave a PowerPoint presentation detailing the history of a 2009 decision to uphold an appeal regarding an Administrative Site Plan Review Application. He noted the application was approved by the Zoning Department for modifying the Presidential Estates Golf Course for residential development. He pointed out the approval was granted without written consent from homeowners, and was rescinded by the Board. When explaining the basis for the consent requirement, Mr. Recio referred to a 1986 covenant agreement established for the golf course property, noting that the covenant stated that without the prior written consent of 51 percent of residential homeowners within the property, the property could not be utilized for other purposes. He further noted the only exceptions were for a golf course, bicycle or jogging paths, and open spaces. He also recounted the history of Board decisions from 1987 through 2009 that upheld the appeal, as well as decisions for similar applications. He stated that the covenant was reinforced by the Boardï¿½s decisions, which required written consent for developing the golf course property for other purposes.  Mr. Recio concluded his presentation by urging the Board to deny the application. Mr. Tucker Gibbs, an attorney representing property owners Mr. Robert Weisblun and Ms. Roslyn Weisblun, who resided on 1800 NE 196 Terrace, Miami, Florida 33179, appeared on their behalf. He asked the Board to deny the application. He submitted for the record a written statement from Ms. Weisblun regarding the impact the development would have on her property. Mr. Mayol introduced Mr. Carlos Gonzalez, Regional Vice President of Lennar Homes. Mr. Gonzalez pointed out the efforts made in an attempt to reach a compromise with the community. He noted that his company had reduced the density size of the development to appease residents and would continue to negotiate with the residents. Mr. Mayol rebutted Mr. Recioï¿½s presentation regarding the covenant. He submitted for the record a letter from a golf course designer that examined the application. In closing, Mr. Mayol asked the Board to approve the application. Chairman Diaz closed the public hearing after no one else came before the Board to speak. Discussion ensued among the Board members regarding the application. Commissioner Heyman detailed the traffic infrastructure and residential components of the area by the development site. She stated that high-end residential neighborhoods surrounded the site, and that previous attempts to alter the makeup of the community with new housing developments failed due to the covenant. Commissioner Heyman voiced her concerns with the application. She opined that the wishes of the communities near the site should be heeded by developers. She stated her biggest concern was that changing the nature of the residents who moved into the communities did not change the requirement for consent to live there. She pointed out that the proposed development would not alleviate the traffic issues in the area. Commissioner Heyman concluded that she was not in support of the application. Following discussion with Assistant County Attorney Kerbel, and Messrs. Recio and Mayol, Commissioner Heyman made a motion to deny the application without prejudice. Commissioner Higgins seconded the motion. Regarding Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ question if the application required consent from residents, Mr. Kogon replied that according to staff position, the development could occur under the auspice of the covenant and consent was not needed. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the staffï¿½s position was legally defensible. Commissioner Cohen Higgins indicated the staffï¿½s position was open to alternative interpretations and asked Mr. Recio why his client had not gone to court to file a declaratory action and asked a judge for an interpretation of the covenant contract language. Mr. Recio answered there was pending litigation between the property owner and his client that was on hold by the County. He noted a complaint was filed against the County in August 2022 to resolve the litigation with a declaratory judgment. Mr. Mayol and Mr. Recio provided more details about the litigation. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel informed Commissioner Cohen Higgins that the staff recommendation was that the current application was consistent with the covenant without modification. He explained that the application provided for a playable golf course in a non-specific configuration, as required by the covenant. Mr. Kogon recounted the history of the original applications, which failed to be approved by the Board in 2006 and 2009. Mr. Recio noted the current application only differed from the original application presented in terms of the housing units. He also stated the position of the homeowners association was that the property could be developed if written consent from the community was acquired. He indicated his willingness to negotiate with the applicant if there was consent. Assistant County Attorney Kerbal detailed the history of the litigation and related cases regarding covenants. Vice Chairman Gilbert III pointed out that according to the 1986 covenant, the golf course could not be developed other uses, except for the noted exceptions, without approval from a majority of property owners and the Board. He questioned how the application could be approved without consent. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel explained the 1986 covenant regarding the design and maintenance of the golf course and alternate uses for the land. He indicated that because of the limited amount of acreage designated for the housing units, consent was not required. Commissioner Regalado opined that consent was needed if the covenant was to be eliminated and she questioned if the homeowners association had the right to eliminate the covenant. Mr. Recio stated the homeowners association had the right to eliminate the covenant and repeated his argument that the land could not be used for reasons other than what was listed in the covenant. Commissioner Regalado stated that the covenant was not well defined and needed specific language. Commissioner Regalado and Mr. Recio and Mr. Mayol discussed the plat of the property and the covenant. Commissioner Regalado pointed out that plats changed all the time and were not legally binding. Commissioner Regalado opined that consent was not legally needed in the covenant. During discussion with Mr.  Mayol and Mr. Recio about the covenant restrictions, Commissioner Regalado pointed out that the covenant did not limit restrictions on the property owner. She added that defined terms regarding the golf course were needed to support Mr. Recioï¿½s position about obtaining written consent. Mr. Mayol informed Commissioner Hardemon that the golf course would be over 5,400 yards after the property was developed. Commissioner Hardemon noted that in the covenant, if the property owner maintained a golf course of at least 5,400 yards then consent was not needed. Mr. Mecio explained how land was to be sold within the property according to the 1986 covenant. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel informed Commissioner Higgins that it could take approximately two to three years for a declaratory judgment action to be issued by a judge. He provided more details about the timeframe and the process of appealing the Boardï¿½s decision about the application. Commissioner Higgins commented that despite how the Board voted, there would be a litigation process following the Boardï¿½s decision. She questioned what would happen if the application was deferred until the declaratory judgment action was issued. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel answered that the deferral could be indefinite and the application might be re-advertised. Commissioner Higgins indicated she was in support of the application because it would help with the Countyï¿½s housing shortage. She added that she expected the applicant to have buffers installed at the development. Chairman Diaz pointed out that the Board faced similar pressures from other communities over proposed developments, many of which had plans for more housing units and higher population densities. He opined that the planned development in the application was minimal in size compared to other proposed developments. He also noted that he had to support the applicationï¿½s development plans as he did for the housing development at the Calusa Country Club Golf Course. Commissioner Garcia stated that any concerns he had with the covenant had been settled during the discussion. He pointed out that the population density at the development was very low when compared to other Board-approved developments. He indicated his support for the application. Commissioner Cohen Higgins opined that if the language within a contract was ambiguous, as was the case with this applicationï¿½s covenant, then it was open to interpretation. She added it was only fair for the residents to rely on the contract language instead of interpretations made by attorneys. She also pointed out that the proposed housing units were for high-income residents and would not address the Countyï¿½s affordable housing problem. She favored deferring the application, but acknowledged Assistant County Attorney Kerbelï¿½s concerns about future litigation and the issuance of a declaratory judgment action. She supported Commissioner Heymanï¿½s position to deny the application. Commissioner Regalado disagreed with Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ comments and opined that the covenant language was clear, but not specific. She also noted that every housing unit built, regardless of its price, impacted the Countyï¿½s housing crisis. She cautioned that if the Board interpreted the covenant without substantiation then it would have far-reaching implications. Vice Chairman Gilbert III agreed with Commissioner Regalado that the covenant was not specific. He opined the issue was with equity and not the covenant, and recommended both parties to negotiate further. He was not in support of denying the application because during litigation, deference may be given to the denial, and he opined the covenant did not prohibit the development. Commissioner Heyman stated that the Board had to make a decision during todayï¿½s meeting. She expressed that the application be denied without prejudice and acknowledged issues faced by the County such as affordable housing and traffic. She supported increasing population density and infill, but was mindful of exceptions made for residents regarding traffic issues. She opined the development would adversely impact traffic for residents from neighboring communities. It was moved by Commissioner Heyman to deny the application without prejudice. Commissioner Higgins seconded the motion, and after being put to a vote the motion failed by a vote of 3-6 (Chairman Diaz, Vice Chairman Gilbert III, and Commissioners Garcia, Cohen Higgins, Hardemon, Regalado, and Higgins voted no; Commissioners Sosa, Monestime and Souto were absent). Mr. Kogon noted the applicationï¿½s original plan for 134 units was reduced to 119 units as proffered by Mr. Mayol. Mr. Kogon stated the development was now restricted to 119 units and that the applicantï¿½s new plan was entered into the record. Commissioner McGhee changed his previous vote to deny the application without prejudice to ï¿½noï¿½; which changed the vote tally to 2-7. Mr. Recio stated an objection for the record because consent was not provided and a two-thirds majority was required to approve the application. There being no questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, per staff recommendation with conditions made by staff. It was moved by Commissioner Heyman to deny the application without prejudice. Commissioner Higgins seconded the motion, and after being put to a vote the motion failed by a vote of 2-7 (Chairman Diaz, Vice Chairman Gilbert III, and Commissioners Garcia, Cohen Higgins, Hardemon, Regalado, McGhee and Higgins voted no; Commissioners Sosa, Monestime and Souto were absent). It was moved by Commissioner Higgins to approve the application with conditions. Commissioner Regalado seconded the motion, and upon being put to a vote, the motion passed by a vote of 7-2 (Commissioners Heyman and Cohen Higgins voted no; Commissioners Sosa, Monestime and Souto were absent). 3B 222087 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: Z2021000123 -- APPLICANT: TC MC HOMESTEAD 50, LLC. -- DISTRICT 09 -- SUMMARY OF REQUESTS:\r\nTHE APPLICANT SEEKS TO PERMIT A REZONING OF THE SUBJECT PARCEL FROM AU (MINIMUM 5 ACRE LOTS) TO RU-3M (MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL, MAXIMUM OF 12.9-UNITS PER ACRE) IN ORDER TO BUILD A 309-UNIT MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, WITH 10% OF THE PROPOSED UNITS RESERVED FOR WORKFORCE HOUSING.

Later in the meeting, Vice Chairman Rodriguez clarified that in the memo Commissioner Cabrera did not object to the hearing of the application.

Commissioner Regalado referred to an adopted ordinance that permitted accessory dwelling units (ADU) in the County (See Agenda Item 5D Substitute, Legislative File No. 221819 at the November 1, 2022 Board of County Commissioners meeting), which was relevant to the application.

Regalado Vote: 9 - 0 Absent, OCB: Cabrera Excused: Gilbert, III , Hardemon , Garcï¿½a REPORT: Ms. Amina Newsome, Senior Division Chief, Miami-Dade Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Department, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests and thirteen waivers were  filed. Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; the following person appeared before the Board to speak in support of the application: -Ms. Lina Ann Myers Wescar (phonetic), 830 NW 96 Street, Miami, Florida. She stated unlawful activities took place in their neighborhood and opined the gate would provide extra protection for children at the school and residents in the area. Seeing no one else appearing to speak, Vice Chairman Rodriguez closed the public hearing. Mr. Jorge Navarro, an attorney representing the applicants, Ades Family Foundation, Inc. and the Jewish Learning Academy, pointed out that he and his colleagues had reached out to the community for support of the application. He gave a PowerPoint presentation that provided details about the applicationï¿½s proposal to construct a perimeter wall in front of the Jewish Learning Academy which was higher than the Countyï¿½s Code. Mr. Navarro announced a neighborhood workshop was held in February 2023 and noted most neighbors preferred the eight-foot wall. Ms. Iris Escarra, an attorney also representing the applicants, provided the Board members a School Security Report by Mr. James Mohano (phonetic), Director, Community Security, Greater-Miami Jewish Federation. Ms. Escarra stated the report concluded the solid privacy wall was an important safety element for the school.  She quoted statistics from Mr. Mohanoï¿½s report which cited anti-Semitic activities reported by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) from 2020 to 2022. The ADL statistics showed that anti-Semitic activities increased every year.  She emphasized the ADL reported a spike of anti-Semitic activities by 34% in 2021 to which 61% occurred at Jewish facilities. Ms. Escarra also noted the increase in the number of anti-Semitic shootings that took place in the past couple of years. Ms. Escarra referenced an article published by K through 12 Drive that reported school related shootings have steadily increased from 114 in year 2020 to 300 shootings in year 2022. She pointed out the privacy wall served as extra protection for the school and would help prevent crime by reducing access to entry points of the property. Ms. Escarra explained the main entry would be located at the main corridor, away from residents to mitigate neighborhood traffic. Rabbi Dr. Gil Perl, CEO, Ades Family Foundation and Head Master of School, Jewish Leadership Academy (JLA) provided a presentation related to the mission of the Jewish School.  He stated JLAï¿½s goals were to retain students and deter them from converting to non-Jewish schools, instill the foundersï¿½ belief to provide service to others and the community, and to make JLA accessible to all students willing to thrive. Rabbi Perlï¿½s PowerPoint presentation provided examples of different companies that partnered with the school to develop students into becoming innovative business leaders and entrepreneurs.  He highlighted the partnered companies and organizations, as follows: -\tDTech Service Center, which trained youth to seek community solutions; -\tGuitars Over Guns, a music studio available for students to record music; -\tJI Foundation, founded by an American Ninja Warrior to train disabled youth to complete Ninja and Spartan optical courses; and -\tNorth Shore Medical Hospital, which had volunteer services. Rabbi Perl reiterated anti-Semitic activities continued to increase and requested the Boardï¿½s support of the foregoing proposed application. Mr. Navarro indicated for the record that there were 13 letters of support submitted by neighbors residing immediately adjacent to the proposed site. Commissioner Bastien sought information regarding the specifications and the importance of the gate to the neighborhood. Mr. Navarro stated there would be sidewalk, roadway, and landscape improvements worth $2 million. He highlighted the wall would be textured with columns and that ficus vines would be installed on the wall to create an aesthetics blend with the landscape.  In addition, Mr. Navarro stated the wall was dense enough to serve as a sound buffer from noise and traffic for security reasons. Ms. Escarra added the wall must be fortified for security purposes to lessen the impact of potential vehicle bombings. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel addressed Commissioner Bastienï¿½s concern related to the lack of residents and community members not present at todayï¿½s public hearing.  Attorney Kerbel advised the Community Council was considered the lower trial court and would normally not appear because the Board served as the appellate court. Ms. Newsome advised this meeting was properly noticed and advertised to the community, noting the attorneysï¿½ representing the applicant held neighborhood meetings, submitted letters of support, and had a representative present at todayï¿½s meeting to address any concerns. Mr. Navarro pointed out that at the direction of the Community Council, he and the applicants held a neighborhood meeting, and obtained 13 letters of support from residents. Commissioner Bastien moved to approve the foregoing application as recommended by RER staff. Commissioner Regalado seconded this motion for discussion. Ms. Newsome reported that RER staff had to modify their recommendation regarding Condition #4; and advised the applicant complied with the platting and traffic memorandum dated July 12, 2022, as indicated under Condition Number 4. Mr. Newsome noted in addition to approval of the gates and as part of the fencing, the applicant was also approved to have the gates opened 30 minutes before school opened. Ms. Newsome requested a modification to read as follows: \"That the applicant complies with all the applicable conditions, requirements, recommendations, requests, and other provisions of the Platting and Traffic Review Section of the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources as approved through the entrance feature application.\" Commissioner Regalado opined a security wall should not be limited to one particular school. She suggested that the Board should consider walls that were higher than the standard perimeters as outlined in the Miami-Dade County Code, particularly regarding Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) that pertained to certain establishments such as schools. Later in the meeting, Commissioner Regalado stated she would work on legislation to amend the zoning code to implement new security standards for school walls. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated she shared similar views with regard to increased safeguards to keep children safe.  She expressed the statistics provided by the applicantï¿½s attorneys was compelling and noted the presentation justified the applicantï¿½s request to install the eight-foot wall. Commissioner Cohen Higgins pointed out there were several additional security measures that could be implemented for future school developments. Commissioner Higgins suggested the CDMP and Planning staff compile information relating to what perimeters should be included to create new safety standards for school walls. In response to Commissioner Higgins query as to whether or not a Boardï¿½s directive was needed to create safety guidelines for school walls, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the zoning code would have to be amended. Commissioner Higgins stated she would support upcoming legislation to amend the zoning code in support of fortified school walls. Commissioner Steinberg stated the presentation provided today by the applicantï¿½s attorney justified the proposed installation of the eight-foot wall. Commissioner Gonzalez agreed with the same sentiments expressed by the Board members relating to the installation of a higher wall standards.  He acknowledged Rabbi Perl for the fortified wall improvement and the schoolï¿½s future educational programs. Vice Chairman Rodriguez requested to be added as a co-sponsor once the legislation to amend the zoning code was created by Commissioner Regalado. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised the Board due to the appeal from the Community Council, this application required a two-thirds vote for approval. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to vote of the foregoing proposed application, per staff recommendation, as presented.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing. There being no one wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Graham Penn, an attorney representing the applicants, Miami-Dade County Public Schools (School Board) and 1370 NE 2nd, LLC, appeared before the Board. Commissioner Cohen Higgins suggested the application be deferred because Commissioner Hardemon, the County Commissioner of District 3, was not present during todayï¿½s (2/23) meeting and was not able to provide any input as per custom with the Board. Commissioner Regalado agreed the application should be deferred, but questioned if the application was time-sensitive. Mr. Russell Galvin, one of the applicants, pointed out that the application process had been ongoing for over seven years and wanted to conclude the process in a timely basis because it was the most important project for the Omni Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA). He added that the application had been publicly noticed and did not have any opponents. Vice Chairman Rodriguez pointed out that he had not received any notices from Commissioner Hardemon about the application. In response to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s question about what would happen to the application, Mr. Galvin replied that the application would go back to the CRA or the School Board. He noted that the application was supposed to have been approved December 2022, and although a deferral would postpone the process, he was willing to accept a 30-day delay. Commissioner Regalado stated that when the application went through the the CRA process, it was supported by Commissioner Hardemon, which was confirmed by Mr. Galvin. She noted no staff from the CRA or from Commissioner Hardemonï¿½s office was present at todayï¿½s meeting to verify the Commissionerï¿½s past support of the application. Commissioner Higgins noted that the Downtown Development Authority supported the application. In response to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ inquiry if RER reviewed the application to determine the projectï¿½s impact on the community and if it provided community benefits, Mr. Kogon affirmed that RER reviewed the application and considered the size of the project as outlined in the application. He added that the applicant proffered $100,000 to either the School Board or the Omni Metromover stations closest to the project. He noted in addition, the property listed in the application had to preserve 100,000 square feet of space dedicated for the Miami-Dade School District within the structure. Commissioner Higgins noted there was widespread support for the application, but it was prudent to get input from Commissioner Hardemon. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel informed Commissioner Higgins that if the application was approved at todayï¿½s meeting, should Commissioner Hardemon later have questions, the application could not be re-opened for discussion. Commissioner Bastien pointed out that the applicant was willing to wait an additional 30 days for the application to be approved, and she supported the motion to defer the application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed with the Board that the application would be deferred to the March 16, 2023, Zoning meeting. There being no further questions or comments, Board proceeded to vote on the deferral of the application. 3D 230327 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000207  --  DISTRICT(S): 09  --  APPLICANT: GOULDS PROPERTY HOLDINGS, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT TO THE GOULDS COMMUNITY URBAN CENTER DISTRICT (GCUCD) LAND USE REGULATING PLAN TO REDESIGNATE THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM R, (RESIDENTIAL), TO RM, (RESIDENTIAL MODIFIED), WITHIN THE EDGE SUB-DISTRICT.  --  LOCATION: 21901 SW 116 AVENUE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Denied without prejudice Zoning Z-6-23 Mover: Kionne L.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; the following persons appeared before the Board to speak in opposition to the application: -Mr. J.L. Demps, Jr., 11025 SW 223 Street, Goulds, Florida, asked several public attendees to stand up to indicate their opposition to the application; -Ms. Carolyn Howard, 14521 Polk Street, Richmond Heights, Florida; -Ms. Gladys Briscoe, 21811 SW 118 Court, Miami, Florida; -Reverend Kathy Simmons Twyne, 21824 SW 113 Avenue, Goulds, Florida; -Ms. Gale Ladeler Wimbley, 22523 SW 113 Place, Goulds, Florida; -Mr. Vernon Twyne, 21824 SW 113 Avenue, Goulds, Florida; -Ms. Celeste Washington, 11261 SW 220 Street, Goulds, Florida, submitted petitions against the application; -Mr. Ken Forbes, 25121 SW 130 Avenue, Princeton, Florida; and -Mr. Rodney Upshaw, 3331 NW 208 Street, Miami Gardens, Florida, the pastor of Mount Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church. Seeing no one else appearing to speak, Vice Chairman Rodriguez closed the public hearing. Mr. Frank Perez, 6665 SW 69 Lane, Miami, Florida, representing the applicant Goulds Property Holdings, Inc. and co-owner of the property noted in the application, submitted a letter of support for the application from an adjacent property owner. He requested that the property he co-owned, which was located on the edge of the Goulds Community Center District (GCUCD) Land Use Residential Plan, had its zoning designation changed from residential (R) to residential modified (RM). Mr. Perez provided details about the property and its surrounding areas. He noted that he met with members of the Mount Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church, who were not supportive of the proposed project to construct a multi-family housing development and wanted to purchase the property to construct their own multi-family development. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel confirmed with Commissioner McGhee that todayï¿½s (2/23) Zoning meeting was quasi-judicial, which meant that Commissioner McGhee was discourage from discussing the application with Goulds residents, except during todayï¿½s meeting. Mr. Kogon explained to Commissioner McGhee the mixed zoning restrictions around the GCUCD and the applicantï¿½s property. Commissioner McGhee confirmed with him that the applicant was allowed to develop multi-family housing units up to two stories high and that the applicant wanted the height of his proposed property increased to six stories, as well as the number of proposed units. The two also discussed the propertyï¿½s restrictions due to the R designation. Mr. Kogon detailed the amount of density allowed in the GCUCD, and that the property outlined in the application was located in what was designated as the Edge District of the GCUCD. He provided information about the number of housing units, the density allowed at the Edge District and the difference between R and RM designations. Commissioner McGhee acknowledged the concerns raised by the Goulds community and provided details about the community.  He voiced that he did not want high-rise structures in the community and stated he was unsupportive of the application. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s question about how RER arrived at its recommendation concerning the application, Mr. Kogon answered that the evaluations of the zoning applications were based on compatibility and County policy. He reported that the property was near a Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit corridor, the urban center, and parcels with similar densities.  He noted that the public hearings were the forum for members of the community to voice their support or opposition to an application. He pointed out that RER did not receive any protests against the application until the night before todayï¿½s meeting. Commissioner McGhee repeated his opposition to the application and motioned that the application be denied. Commissioner Cohen Higgins seconded the motion for discussion. Commissioner Cohen Higgins opined it was important for county commissioners to determine if applications and projects would be compatible within their communities. She noted the area surrounding the applicantï¿½s property was not compatible for high-rise buildings and acknowledged the community did not support the applicantï¿½s project. She was unsupportive of the application. Commissioner Regalado clarified that the area surrounding the property was designated an urban center. She also explained what were urban centers and the staff recommendation in the application. Mr. Kogon provided more details about the urban center and nearby properties. He reiterated that the property was located next to the urban center. He informed Commissioner Regalado the applicant could currently construct 27 housing units on the property. Commissioner Regalado supported Commissioner McGheeï¿½s motion but noted that the area was not designated for single-family housing but for higher-density housing. Commissioner McGhee expressed gratitude to the Goulds residents who attended todayï¿½s meeting. He asked Mr. Demps what was his vision for the community. Mr. Demps replied that he planned a smaller development with a downtown area. He also mentioned that he originally planned townhomes to be constructed but was prevented by density regulations. He commented that the proposed development by the applicant was not compatible with the community. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s inquiry if it was possible to maintain current regulations at the site and prevent this situation from reoccurring, Mr. Kogon noted that denying the application preserved the status quo. Mr. Kogon stated that applicants were allowed to request whatever property designation they wished, however, he added that the decision by the Board regarding an application would remain in the public record. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed that applicants were not prohibited from submitting applications, but pointed out that compatibility with a community was a factor that the Board considered when approving or denying applications. Commissioner Bermudez cautioned that this situation could recur throughout the County as the population increased and sought input on how this issue could be addressed with future applications. Mr. Kogon responded that RER advised applicants of their geographic location within communities and of potential issues that could arise.  He pointed out that it was up to the applicants to meet with residents, and he reiterated that RER provided public notices about applications. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel confirmed with Commissioner Bermudez that applicants were able to meet with community members based on a timeframe whether an application was approved or not.  He stated that if an application was denied without prejudice, the applicant could only re-submit an application twelve months after it was denied, or eighteen months if the application was denied with prejudice. Commissioner Regalado noted that this situation would recur and advised the Goulds residents to negotiate with future applicants about density. There being no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to deny the application without prejudice.

There being no persons registered or appearing wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. -Mr. Arza, appeared on behalf of the applicant, South Riviera Investments, Inc., and requested to increase student capacity for Grades 1 through 5 from 18 to 28 students. He indicated the total student capacity would remain the same. Commissioner Regalado recommended staff consider revising the policy to prevent applicants from having to come before the Board to simply adjust student enrollment numbers, particularly when there was no impact to the community or traffic. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised that the Countyï¿½s Code could be changed to provide for an administrative adjustment following a hearing. Mr. Kogon clarified that more modern applications allowed for flexibility in student enrollment; however, in this instance, the applicant was bound by an older resolution, which required the Boardï¿½s approval.

Mr. Ben Fernandez, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida attorney representing the applicant, Jekami Properties, LLC, appeared before the Board, to request a deferral of the foregoing zoning application. He noted no quorum was present for the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB/Community Council). Mr. Fernandez noted the request for the deferral with leave to amend indefinitely so the applicant could bring the application back when it was ready. Mr. Kogon noted there would be a re-noticing requirement for the application when it was ready. There being no objections, the Board proceeded to vote on the deferral of the application to no date certain. Following consideration of the application, Commissioner Regalado noted the deferral of many of the zoning applications/items because a community council did not consider the applications. She asked if the Commission Auditor could provide a report on what was happening with the community councils particularly as it related to a quorum because it was becoming problematic. Commissioner Regalado noted the need for a systematic review in order to address the issue. In conclusion, she reiterated the main issue for most of the deferrals requested was the lack of a quorum for the applicable community councils. Commissioner Rodriguez agreed with Commissioner Regalado and noted he spoke to staff about the need to fill vacant community council seats. Mr. Kogon noted RER staff was working on the process of making appointments to the community councils. He mentioned staff had a report with the breakdown of each of the community councils, and  referenced particularly CZAB 10, and 11 that  encountered the quorum issue.

Mr. Jerry Proctor, 7600 Red Road, South Miami, Florida, attorney representing the applicant, appeared before the Board along with his colleagues and noted staffï¿½s support of the foregoing zoning application. He commented his client was in agreement with staffï¿½s recommendation and the conditions. Chairman Gilbert III opened public hearing. Mr. David Greenfield, 2655 NE 186 Street, Miami, Florida, appeared before the Board, noting his property was located next to the subject property and separated by a small street. He commented the subject area was a flood area and expressed his concern that the foregoing application could lead to additional flooding. Mr. Proctor stated the applicantï¿½s development was an expansion of an existing self-storage development on the current site. He also referenced the applicantï¿½s compliance with the Countyï¿½s current storm water rules and the flood criteria rules, which was strengthened over the last few years. Mr. Proctor stated this development would have to go through a re-plat process that would be presented to this Board for consideration and obtain a building permit with all of the necessary reviews. He stated the applicant was ready to comply with all of the rules. Commissioner Steinberg questioned what could be built on this subject site. In response to Commissioner Steinbergï¿½s question, Mr. Kogon provided an explanation on the allowable use for the subject site.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing, and the following person appeared before the Board: 1. \tMs. Melissa Tapanes Llahues, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin Tapanes Zoning and Environmental Law, presented a Power Point presentation on behalf of the applicant. She urged the Board to modify the covenant to remove the 4,000 square foot limitation, and the current parking requirement. Ms. Tapanes Llauhes acknowledged staffï¿½s recommendation, but suggested an alternative that would grant the applicant non-use variance parking standards. She clarified that instead of the applicant providing 41 parking spaces, they would provide 16. Seeing no other persons wishing to speak, Vice Chairman Rodriguez closed the public hearing. Mr. Kogon stated that staff believed the land-use for this application would be classified as industrial and not business. He noted that the application called for a storage room, with show room, which was why the parking standard was enforced. Mr. Kogon clarified that if the applicationï¿½s classification switched to commercial construction it would be considered sale-use and the parking standard would not be met. Ms. Tapanes Llahues noted that if the layout of the construction changed, the item would return to the Board; thus, the applicantï¿½s submittal of alternatives today. Commissioner Regalado stated although she supported the application, she believed the additional parking would not be needed if the applicantï¿½s intent was to maintain the property for storage. She noted if the item was presented for consideration again, then her colleagues could decide if more parking was necessary. Commissioner Regalado voiced her concerns that if the Board assumed the applicant was utilizing the property for its highest use without acknowledging the parameters set in the application, then that could generate an unfavorable precedent for future applicants. Discussion ensued between Assistant County Attorney (ACA) Dennis Kerbel and Mr. Kogon regarding the non-use variance and the possibility of the item returning to the Board. Commissioner Bermudez stated that he supported the application, but concurred with Commissioner Regalado comments and concerns. There being no other comments or objections, the Board approved the foregoing application with staffï¿½s recommendation. 4/20/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1B 230778 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000298  --  DISTRICT(S): 08  --  APPLICANT: RICHARD R.

Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the Board that the public hearing had already been held on this foregoing proposed application. Commissioner Bastien reminded the Board members of her reservations on this application and for the applicant to meet with the churches and schools located in close proximity to the subject property. Mr. Mark Grafton, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Shutts and Bowen, attorney representing the applicant, appeared before the Board and presented a PowerPoint presentation. He noted there were three churches in the area and pointed out there were no objections from the churches or the school in the area. Commissioner Bastien stated she would be willing to approve the zoning request with conditions that the applicant contribute funding to support an educational campaign about underage drinking, and leadership development to schools and libraries within three-mile radius. In response to Assistant County Attorney Kerbelï¿½s question regarding the contribution amount, Commissioner Bastien asked the applicant to work with the County Attorneyï¿½s office to determine an amount. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the condition was for the applicant to fund programs in  schools within a three-mile radius to discourage underage drinking and to fund counseling or leadership programs related to discouraging underage drinking. Chairman Gilbert suggested that the applicant work with the commissionerï¿½s office to effectuate the condition as requested. He asked if the condition was acceptable to the applicant, and Mr. Grafton responded yes. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified the motion was not per staffï¿½s recommendation and he stated the motion before the Board was to approve request number 1, 3, and 4 with standard conditions to tie them to the site plan and the aforementioned condition regarding the contribution; and denial of request number 2, which was not necessary because of the approval of the rezoning in request number 1. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s questions regarding the window of time to discuss parameters, Commissioner Bastien stated by September 2023. There being no further questions or comments, the Board approved request numbers 1, 3 and 4 with standard conditions to tie the applicant to the site plans,  with an additional condition that the applicant contribute funding to support educational campaign about underage drinking, and leadership development to schools, libraries within a three-mile radius; and denial of request number 2. 3/16/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board 4/20/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board APPEAL ITEM(S) 2A 231439 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000221  --  DISTRICT(S): 08  --  APPLICANT: ARCHIMEDES XXII, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS APPROVAL OF A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM AU, AGRICULTURE DISTRICT, TO EU-M, SINGLE-FAMILY MODIFIED ESTATE DISTRICT.

He noted this application was an appeal and if the Board decided to overturn the Community Zoning Appeals Board (CZAB) recommendation, it would require a two-thirds vote of the Board members present. Chairman Gilbert III opened public hearing. Mr. Miguel Rodriguez, 17262 SW 284 Street, Homestead, Florida, expressed his concern that the one-time impact fee would not help the schools in the subject area. He proceeded to inform the Board of the following issues impacted by this application in the subject area: the overcrowding at schools, the applicant not affording workforce housing, the possibility of higher density and the traffic. Ms. Jolinda Rodriguez, 17262 SW 284 Street, Miami, Florida, made comments regarding the changes to the housing development in the subject area. She expressed concern regarding construction trucks having a negative impact on traffic in the subject area. Ms. Rodriguez stated the tranquility in the Redland area would change due to the development of homes on the subject site for this zoning application. There being no one else appearing wishing to speak, Chairman Gilbert III closed the public hearing. Mr. Brian Adler, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, Florida, attorney representing the applicant Archimedes XXII, LLC, addressed various comments made by speakers and gave a PowerPoint presentation regarding the applicationï¿½s requests. He clarified that this application was for 85 units and designated as estate density residential and not agricultural; and that county staff had recommended approval. Mr. Adler indicated with workforce housing bonuses, the maximum his client could build on the property was 85 units. He advised that the proffered covenant addressed the lot size and lot frontage and would not be reduced below what was presented in conceptual site plan submitted with this zoning application. Mr. Adler also advised the Board of the payment in lieu of construction of seven workforce-housing units for $847,609 to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund 60-days after final approval and of the maximum number of 85 dwelling units to be developed on the property. Additionally, he stated a separate covenant regarding connection to water and sewer facilities would be proffered. Mr. Adler noted approval of this zoning application had no objections from all of the appropriate departments. A brief discussion ensued among Commissioner Cohen Higgins, Mr. Adler and Mr. Kogon regarding the current zoning designation, the allowable development under the Comprehensive Plan, the zoning application request, and the compatibility with the surrounding area. Commissioner Cohen Higgins asked Mr. Adler if the density could be reduced   and noting the residents concerns regarding the need for affordable housing, but did not want it in their neighborhood due to the effect such would have on property values. She noted that despite substantial developments in the South Dade and Redland areas, there were little improvements in the Countyï¿½s affordability housing crisis. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated the prices for the homes were not affordable for young people, nurses, doctors and teachers and reiterated her request for decreased density. In response to the comments regarding the density, Mr. Adler noted due to the high construction costs, there needed to be balance in order to provide estate products.  He noted amendments to the Miami-Dade County Code (Code) in 2016 for workforce housing recognizing that if the responsibility of building workforce housing were left to the County or the developers, it would not move forward.  Mr. Adler noted that the 2016 legislation was not working; therefore, an increase in the incentives to build workforce housing was necessary. He stated the incentive was to provide a density increase, but a developer could not obtain those incentives unless they build on smaller lots. Mr. Adler noted the density increase was consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations; therefore, the applicant would have to increase the density. He commented the affordability was based on the area and the lot size in order to develop a product that would be consistent with the area. He asked the Board for a moment to meet with his client to discuss the density. Commissioner Cohen Higgins noted one home per five acres in the Redland area was not an ideal area for workforce housing because it would not make sense economically, noting that was the reason why the majority of the workforce housing and density was located near the busway and along the rapid transit zones. She agreed and asked that the Board allow Mr. Adler to speak with his client regarding the density. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s inquiry for the historical background of the foregoing application, Mr. Kogon spoke regarding the Community Zoning Appeals Boardï¿½s (CZAB/Community Council) denial of the foregoing application, noting six Community Council members unanimously voted against the application. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s comments regarding it would require a two-thirds vote of the Board members present to overturn the CZABï¿½s decision, Mr. Kogon stated that the foregoing application was an appeal to this Board, a de novo hearing and it would require a two-thirds vote of the Board members for approval of appeal. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s question regarding who currently owns the land in this application, Mr. Adler responded Mr. Leonard Abess owned the property through a revocable trust. Commissioner McGhee stated the land currently had the protection of the agricultural designation. In response to Commissioner McGheeï¿½s comments, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised it is not a designation, but was zoned agriculture (AU) and it had an estate density residential designation. Commissioner McGhee made further comments regarding the neglect of the South Dade area and stated he would not vote in support of the application. He suggested issuing a moratorium to forbid increased density in certain agricultural land areas that were 5 acres or more.  In an effort to maintain the South Dade Redland area, he asked his colleagues to vote ï¿½noï¿½ on this item. Commissioner McGhee stated the County was partly responsible for the creation of the issues facing South Dade. He commented on the issues facing farmers in the Redlands due to county policy. Commissioner McGhee explained that the Countyï¿½s fines were forcing the farmers to sell their properties to developers. He opined the area should be kept at one home per five acres. Mr. Adler requested a deferral to the September 20, 2023, Zoning Board meeting on behalf of his client. Commissioner Cohen Higgins expressed her concern regarding Commissioner McGheeï¿½s comments and commented that if he  wanted to place a moratorium over development in District 9, she encouraged him to create legislation to do so. Commissioner Cohen Higgins made a motion to defer the foregoing zoning application to the September 20, 2023, Zoning Board meeting. Commissioner Higgins seconded this motion. Chairman Gilbert III commented on the community council review process and urged his colleagues to acknowledge the community councilsï¿½ concerns.  He indicated that while there had been ongoing discussions about affordable housing in  Miami-Dade County, the Board needed to recognize its role in the problem.  He expressed a real conversation was needed regarding density; and that building density in certain commission districts would not bring down housing cost. Commissioner Hardemon and Mr. Kogon had a brief discussion regarding the different categories for estate (EU) designation. Commissioner Hardemon commented on the lot sizes, the urban development boundary (UBD) line and workforce housing, that affordable housing should be everywhere in Miami-Dade County. Commissioner Regalado made comments regarding the County having an affordable housing and a workforce housing inventory issue. She stated the Board needed to make changes to the Countyï¿½s Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) to make the Boardï¿½s expectations clear. Commissioner Higgins echoed Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s comments and noted that the County had an acute affordable housing crisis, which would become  worse. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel clarified that the motion before the Board was to defer the foregoing application to the September 20, 2023, Zoning Board meeting, with leave to amend. There being no further questions or comments, the Board approved the deferral of the foregoing application to the September 20, 2023, Zoning Board meeting, with leave to amend.

Mr. Kogon noted staff looked at the neighborhood compatibility, the use of infrastructure in the surrounding area, and the policies for housing opportunities along the corridor. In response to Commissioner Gonzalezï¿½ question regarding the allowable density per the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP) within the subject area, Mr. Kogon responded stating it would be a maximum of 500 units total at 60 units per acre.

Regalado Vote: 7 - 4 No: Gilbert, III , Hardemon , Higgins , Garcï¿½a Excused: Steinberg , Gonzalez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department, read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no waivers filed and 13 protests.  Additionally, he advised the public hearing on this application was already held. Commissioner Bastien inquired whether any updates were available regarding the discussions between the applicant and the residents. Mr. Javier Vasquez, Berger Singerman, representing West Group Developers, LLC, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, noted that the administration recommended approval, despite the residentsï¿½ dissatisfaction with the application. He noted that Commissioner Bastien requested that the applicant meet with the residents, but the applicant was unable to come to an agreement with the community. Mr. Edward ï¿½Eddieï¿½ Baker, Berger Singerman, 1450 Brickell Avenue, stated he gave a PowerPoint presentation on the proposed development at a Planning Advisory Board (PAB) meeting, and tried to address all of the residentsï¿½ concerns. Mr. Baker noted that the residents were still not in agreement with the project, and assured the Board members that he had provided them with all the information related to the development plans. Commissioner Bastien noted she had several reservations on the project, and would like the applicant to find consensus with the residents. Chairman Gilbert III stated that the County had a great need for housing , and that residents should not turn down an opportunity for progress due to change. He emphasized that housing affordability was his main concern, and that the process may need to be reviewed because the current system was not sustainable. Commissioner Cohen Higgins stated she understood Commissioner Bastienï¿½s sentiments and noted that projects like the proposed development would not be necessary for all districts. She highlighted that every time there was communal opposition to an application in her district, she would recommend that the applicant work out differences with the residents; if a consensus was not feasible, then the development would not be approved. Commissioner Hardemon stated that both residents and applicants would not always agree on all the terms and conditions of a development. He noted that it could be hard to move forward with a project with such strong opposition from the community, but the Board had to make an important decision. Commissioner Hardemon stated that the County had a lack of affordable housing due to private companies not wanting to invest in certain neighborhoods. He continued that while the main goal for developers would be to make a profit, he believed if companies invested in under-developed communities it could give way to further economic development. Commissioner Hardemon spoke about the merits of the application. Commissioner McGhee concurred with Commissioner Hardemon, but stated that he would support Commissioner Bastienï¿½s final decision. He noted that although Commissioner Bastienï¿½s concerns were valid, this development could be an economic engine for her district. Commissioner McGhee emphasized that the administrationï¿½s notes does not recognize the full potential of the proposed development. Commissioner Higgins noted that the Countyï¿½s primary issue was housing, specifically related to supply and demand. She stated that every application needed to address population density, and some communities may have to manage higher rates to fully serve the community. Commissioner Higgins noted that  the district commissioner would have to work through issues with neighbors to make sure they felt heard, but noted that she would not vote against housing due to the extreme need. She concluded her comments by urging Commissioner Bastien to move forward with the application to help solve the Countyï¿½s current issue. Chairman Gilbert III concurred with Commissioner Higgins, and noted that the proposed application was a very restrictive and contained project and indicated his support for the application. Commissioner Regalado explained that higher density would bring more resources to the community and noted that that residents wanted the benefits without the population increase. Commissioner Bermudez echoed Chairman Gilbert IIIï¿½s sentiments and mentioned the difficulty in promoting the positive attributes of a development with a large number of residents in opposition. He stated that he agreed with Commissioner Cohen Higgins, and would support the application. Responding to Commissioner Bermudezï¿½s inquiry about the Countyï¿½s agricultural report, Mr. Jerry Bell, Office of Metropolitan Planning, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), stated that the report would be available by October 2023. Commissioner Bastien asked how the applicant would address possible noise and traffic concerns, and if the applicant was willing to increase workforce housing. Mr. Vazquez stated that the proposed development was only a two-story building, and noted that the applicant met the traffic requirements. He noted that the applicant went above the 10% workforce housing requirement to provide 20%. Mr. Vazquez emphasized that residents were not open to compromising on the development. Commissioner Bastien encouraged the applicant to meet with residents again but stated that the Comprehensive Master Development Plan (CDMP) portion of the application was approved. She emphasized that the zoning hearing today served as a way to align the two developments, thus residents should be more accommodating and willing to compromise. Mr. Vasquez stated that the application would be amenable to increasing the workforce housing component to 25% if the application was approved today. Commissioner Bastien urged the applicant to meet with the residents again to accommodate both parties. After an extensive discussion, Commissioner Bastien moved to defer Zoning Application Z2020000084 to the next Zoning meeting, so the applicant would have the opportunity to resolve the residentsï¿½ concerns. There being no other comments or objections, the Board by motion duly made, seconded, and carried, deferred the foregoing item to the October 19, 2023, Zoning meeting. 7/19/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1B 231441 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000039  --  DISTRICT(S): 03  --  APPLICANT: LADOAN PROPERTIES II, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS APPROVAL OF A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM RU-2 (TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL USE) AND BU-2 (BUSINESS USE) TO MCD (MIXED-USE) IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE SITE WITH A 5-STORY MIXED-USE BUILDING WITH RETAIL AND 44 RESIDENTIAL UNITS, INCLUDING WORKFORCE HOUSING.

Mr. Kogon stated that there would be a six-foot masonry wall included with the landscaping, which was required by the County Code. Mr. Diaz de la Portilla confirmed that the landscaping would exceed the County requirements, with no connectivity between both parcels. Commissioner Cabrera asked for clarification on the conditions of Parcel B. Mr. Kogon stated the applicant was permitted to build single-family homes on the property, however any other development would need the community council and Boardï¿½s approval.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; seeing no one come forward to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Javier Aviï¿½ï¿½, Blizin Sumberg, 200 S Biscayne Blvd, Miami, appeared on behalf of the applicant,  1st and 8th, LLC., and provided a brief overview of the proposed development. He noted the applicant requested to modify the proffered covenant to increase the transit contribution from $750,000 to $1.5 million. Commissioner Higgins thanked the applicant for their contribution to improve transit, and noted that building housing within the Rapid Transit Zone (RTZ) would benefit the residents and community. She emphasized that developers who built housing close to transit or within the RTZ should be responsible for repairs to the transit systems surrounding them, due to their occupants utilizing these services the most. Commissioner Higgins stated that stricter guidelines for Uber/Lyft drop-offs needed to be enforced to secure public safety and inquired about the drop-off lane design. Mr. Kogon stated that these drop-off lanes would have ample space, within the facility, for off-street loading. Commissioner Higgins pointed out that the drop-off lanes and landscaping were very important to the design of future developments. She explained that she and the administration decided it would be best for the applicants for Zoning applications Z202200022 (Agenda Item 3C), Z2022000291 (Agenda Item 3D), and Z2022000292 (Agenda Item 3E) to share the cost of any operational analyses, landscaping, and any improvements to street and pedestrian walkways on a pro rata basis. Mr. Aviï¿½ï¿½ agreed to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ conditions. Commissioner Higgins noted that the applicants would also share the cost of funding a wayfinding system to help residents navigate throughout Downtown Miami and locate the newly developed Underline. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel advised the Board members that the applicant had proffered a revised covenant to: - Increase the transit improvement contribution to $1.5 million, - Required that the property owner coordinate with the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) and other applicants to perform an analysis of Southwest 1 Avenue, Southwest 2nd Avenue, and SW 9th Street, -Identify appropriate intersection, roadway, sidewalk, wayfinding signage, and other operational improvements that may be necessary to address the collective vehicular, transit, bike, and pedestrian impacts of the approved projects, - Assess a proportionate share of the cost to each development. Commissioner Bermudez inquired about the cost of the units. Mr. Aviï¿½ï¿½ stated the layout of units would vary from studios to 3 bedroom units, noting that all units would be sold at market rate, with the lowest rental rate being $2,000 a month for a studio. Commissioner Bermudez stated he would support all three applications, but stated that developers should keep housing affordable for all residents. He requested Mr. Kogon, prepare a report identifying the future plans for the RTZ and the number of housing units included in this project to ensure the development would benefit the County. Commissioner Regalado concurred with Commissioner Higgins comments and noted that those wishing to live without a car would depend heavily on the RTZ, thus making improvements to the quality of public options necessary. She stated that those who live within the RTZ have been accepting of higher population density rates, and enjoyed the resources that would be provided by developers.  Commissioner Regalado requested Mr. Kogon, to prepare an analysis on the productivity of the RTZ in various areas. There being no other comments or objections, the Board approved the application, per staffï¿½s recommendation, with the following additional conditions: to increase the transit improvement contribution to $1.5 million, require that the property owner coordinate with the DTPW and other applicants to perform an analysis of Southwest 1 Avenue, Southwest 2nd Avenue, and SW 9th Street, identify appropriate intersection, roadway, sidewalk, wayfinding signage, and other operational improvements that may be necessary to address the collective vehicular, transit, bike, and pedestrian impacts of the approved projects, and assess a proportionate share of the cost to each development. 3D 231796 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000291  --  DISTRICT(S): 05  --  APPLICANT: MENESSE BRICKELL, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICATION IS REQUESTING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION TO PERMIT APPROVAL OF AN INITIAL REVIEW OF THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR A SUBJECT PROPERTY LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BRICKELL METROMOVER STATION, AND ASSIGN TO IT THE PERMITTED USES AND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE UNDER SECTION 33C-15 OF THE COUNTY CODE FOR THE ''METROMOVER STATION SUBZONE''.  --  LOCATION: 143 SW 9 STREET, CITY OF MIAMI, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved with conditions Zoning Z-35-23 Mover: Eileen Higgins Seconder: Kevin Marino Cabrera Vote: 11 - 0 Excused: Steinberg , Gonzalez REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department, read into the record the titles of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests and no waivers filed.

Gilbert, III Vote: 8 - 0 Absent, OCB: McGhee Excused: Hardemon , Higgins , Rodrï¿½guez , Bermudez REPORT: Ms. Amina Newsome, Senior Division Chief, Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were 13 protests and 0 waivers filed. Assistant County Attorney Eddie Kirtley advised the Board of County Commissioners (Board), that the public hearing was previously held. Chairman Gilbert III acknowledged Ms. Lynda Harris, Ms. Becky Moore and Ms. Cordelia Anderson had registered to speak in support of the foregoing application; and requested the applicant limit the presentation to the differences in the application since it was last considered by the Board. Mr. Javier Vazquez, Berger Singerman LLP, 1450 Brickell Avenue, Miami, representing the applicant, West Group Developers, LLC., recounted the history of the application and reviewed its benefits. He also noted that staff recommended approval. After detailing the applicationï¿½s landscaping and infrastructural improvements, Mr. Vazquez stated the applicant was willing to revise the covenant to include additional landscaping and speed bumps, and noted copies of the revised covenant were distributed to the Board. Commissioner Bastien noted that she had requested staff coordinate with the applicant and the community to facilitate a meeting and asked why the meeting did not occur. Ms. Newsome explained that only the applicant attended the scheduled meeting. Commissioner Bastien inquired as to why no community members attended the meeting. Assistant County Attorney Dennis Kerbel confirmed with Chairman Gilbert III that the public hearing was opened and closed. Chairman Gilbert III announced that he would not re-open the public hearing to find out why no community members attended the meeting. He informed Commissioner Bastien she could specifically ask about the lack of attendance. Mr. Munir Ingram, a member of the Little River Farms Homeowners Association (LRFHA), noted the applicant had been invited by LRFHA to attend meetings in the past and had cancelled twice. He continued that the applicant provided short notice for meetings, sometimes giving only 24 hoursï¿½ notice, which led to issues with the community attending since most were seniors. Mr. Ingram also contended that concerns about flooding in the area were not answered by the applicant. Mr. Vazquez informed the Board that his associate Mr. Eddie Baker attended a meeting with the community and the residents acted aggressively and offensively towards Mr. Baker and the applicant. In response to Commissioner Bastienï¿½s question as to whether she could discuss the zoning application with the applicant, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised due to the Jennings Rule, commissioners were not permitted to meet with applicants, objectors or community members outside of a publicly noticed meeting. Commissioner Bastien sought clarification from staff about an applicationï¿½s approval process especially when the community present concerns regarding its environmental impact. Ms. Newsome clarified that staff had not identified any environmental issues with the foregoing application. In response to Commissioner Bastienï¿½s request, Mr. Vazquez detailed the benefits to the community, which included a station on site that would allow residential homes to connect to the Countyï¿½s sewer infrastructure, landscaping and speed bumps. Commissioner Bastien noted that the item had been deferred twice and there were many opportunities for the community to meet with the applicant to provide input on the development, which were not taken. Consequently, Commissioner Bastion made a motion to approve the application per staff recommendation. Chairman Gilbert III seconded the motion and expressed his support for the application. He also stated that any objections to an application needed substantial evidence to support the objections. Commissioner Regalado commended the infrastructural improvements of the application. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel noted the motion would include the newly proffered amendments to be incorporated into the covenant, which included additional landscaping as shown in the printed material distributed to the Board, and described by staff, and speed bumps. He clarified however that the speed bumps were subject to review and approval from the Miami-Dade Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW). The applicant indicated their commitment to working with DTPW to obtain approval of the speed bumps. Hearing no other questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, per staff recommendation. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-39-23. 7/19/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board 9/20/2023 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1B 230770 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2022000089  --  DISTRICT(S): 11  --  APPLICANT: LIFTED CHURCH, INC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING DAY CARE CENTER ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY INTO A PRIVATE SCHOOL WITH GRADES FROM PRE-K TO 6, KEEPING THE SAME MAXIMUM TOTAL OF 144 STUDENTS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED FOR THE FACILITY.

Commissioner Gonzalez read a statement of conflict into the record and noted it was done under the advisement of the County Attorneyï¿½s Office. Chairman Gilbert III commented that he did not believe Commissioner Gonzalez being a member of ï¿½Lifted Church,ï¿½ the applicant of the foregoing item, to be a conflict of interest. Commissioner Gonzalez reiterated he was following the advice of the County Attorneyï¿½s Office and exited the chambers for the Board to consider the application. Mr. James Williams, 701 Brickell Avenue, Miami, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Lifted Church, Inc., and briefly reviewed the application.  He noted the applicant was seeking to expand the existing day care center   into a private school with grades from Pre-K to Grade 6.  Mr. Williams noted the maximum capacity would remain at 144 students, the same amount as previously approved for the daycare.  Mr. Williams further requested the Board consider waiving the filing requirements to allow the applicant to file the zoning application within six (6) months.

Chairman Gilbert III opened the public hearing, and seeing no one appear wishing to speak, closed the public hearing. Mr. Intiraymi Figueroa, applicant, 16421 SW 292 Street, Miami, noted staff recommendation contained several inaccuracies, including the lot size and address.  He briefly reviewed his zoning request and noted the shed had been on the property for the past 30 years, which he was able to verify from a copy of the original permit and design from 1992.  Addressing staffï¿½s comments that the shed would have a negative visual impact, Mr. Figueroa noted there were properties in the vicinity with up to four (4) sheds, while he was simply asking to keep the two (2) sheds currently on his property. Responding to Chairman Gilbertï¿½s III question as to whether the foregoing application would have been considered by the Community Zoning Appeals Board 14 (CZAB), Ms. Newsome confirmed that the matter would have been addressed at the CZAB if there was quorum. Discussion ensued between Chairman Gilbert III and Ms. Newsome regarding staffï¿½s reason for recommending denial. Chairman Gilbert III made a motion to approve the application with standard conditions. Hearing no other questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application, with standard conditions. The foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned Zoning Resolution Number Z-45-23. Additional discussion ensued among Chairman Gilbert III and Commissioners Garcia and Regalado regarding legislation to address Community Council issues such as attendance and quorum. Chairman Gilbert III questioned if staff had the ability to administratively grant similar requests. Ms. Newsome explained administrative approval was not possible in this case because of the size of the shed in question. Discussion ensued among Chairman Gilbert III, Commissioner Regalado and Ms. Newsome about legislation sponsored by Vice Chairman Rodriguez to address sheds, specifically the number and size of the structures. 3G 231997 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2023000092  --  DISTRICT(S): 09  --  APPLICANT: MT.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing, and the following persons appeared before the Board: 1. \tMs. Rebecca Valera, 1222 SW 74 Ave, Miami, FL spoke in opposition of the application.  She voiced her concerns about the proposed changes to the zoning designation from multi-family residential to business district, the increased parking and the applicantï¿½s plans to lower the boundary walls. Ms. Valera pointed out if the walls were lowered the toxic fumes from the fueling of vans would affect residents. 2. Mr. Jose Versaillo (Phonetically), 901 SW 76 Avenue, Miami, FL, spoke in opposition of the foregoing application citing concerns about the toxic fumes resulting from the fueling of the trucks.  He also noted the existing fence between the business and the residences was not secure which, he contended was a factor in his home being burglarized.  Mr. Jose Versaillo (Phonetically) concurred with the comments made by the previous speaker regarding the redesignation of the property and argued it was incompatible with the surrounding community Mr. Ben Fernandez, 200 South Biscayne Blvd, FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant, 7500 SW 8 St, LLC., and presented a PowerPoint presentation highlighting the location of the subject property and the applicantï¿½s request to provide parking for medical uses. He clarified that the application sought approval for service parking; and noted the immediate residents were in support of the application.  Mr. Fernandez provided a brief overview of the application, emphasizing that no zoning change was being requested, but instead a request was being made for an unusual use to allow the service parking.  He advised that any car-washing and refueling activities would be done close to the building and away from the residents.  Mr. Fernandez maintained that the application was compatible with the surrounding areas and contended that the service parking would help alleviate traffic congestion in the area. Seeing no other persons wishing to speak, Vice Chairman Rodriguez closed the public hearing. Commissioner Cabrera inquired about the wall on the property and whether a garage could be built on the property at this time and/or if one could be built in the future without the Boardï¿½s approval. Mr. Silva explained that the applicant could build a garage at this time if they chose to do so.  He further noted if the foregoing application were to be approved it would make the construction of the garage more difficult because it would require the Boardï¿½s approval.  Mr. Silva clarified that the subject property currently contained a fence which, the applicant offered to replace with a wall.  He confirmed that the wall component could be made a condition of approval. In response to Commissioner Cabreraï¿½s question as to whether any new activities would be approved as part of the application, Mr. Silva noted that the subject property was currently being used for parking, which had been brought to RER as a violation.  He explained that the applicant was working on addressing this violation. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cabrera and Mr. Silva regarding the applicantï¿½s request to permit service parking on the property. Mr. Fernandez briefly reviewed the parking and landscaping plans for the property. Mr. Silva confirmed that the applicant would not be permitted to build anything else on the subject property, aside from paving the service parking area, if the application were to be approved today. Commissioner Cabrera acknowledged the comments made by the speakers and concluded that better code enforcement was needed in the area and stated his staff would be in contact about the issue. Commissioner Cabrera moved to deny Request No. 5 and approve Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 ,6, 7 and 8 with standard conditions; and the additional conditions that the subject property only be used as a parking lot to serve the medical office and to require that the applicant build the wall. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel stated that the site plan which would be approved as a part of the standard condition, included the wall and requested clarification from staff. Following confirmation from Mr. Silva that the site plan did include the wall, Assistant County Attorney Kerbel recommended the wall still be included as a condition of approval. Commissioner Bermudez questioned whether the Board received updated information regarding applications. Assistant County Attorney Kerbel advised that the Zoning Agenda form provided the most current information including protests and waivers and noted additional information may be received following the printing of the agenda. Mr. Silva stated in this case, since the agenda was printed; the two (2) additional speakers appeared before the Board. Commissioner Bermudez stated that his question stemmed from comments made by the applicant that the adjacent neighbors did not oppose the application but two (2) residents appeared in opposition of the item.  He asked that staff provide more complete information to the Board detailing all objectors and supporters to make the process more efficient and transparent. Mr. Fernandez noted that the documents from the abutting residents supporting the application was forwarded to staff today.

Mr. Penn advised the proposed language would read as follows: ï¿½At least one acre of public open space shall be located on Parcel A, and at least one acre of public open space shall be located on Parcel B; both of which shall be provided simultaneously to the development on Parcels A and B.  The open space shall be in the form of plazas, greens, or squares as defined under the Miami-Dade County Standard Urban Center District Regulations.ï¿½ In light of the District Commissionerï¿½s absence from todayï¿½s (12/13) meeting and the memorandum of support she submitted regarding the foregoing application, as presented; Vice Chairman Rodriguez asked if the condition read into the record by Mr. Penn was included in the application before the Board. Assistant County Attorney (ACA) Dennis Kerbel explained the applicant was still providing the two acres of open space as required, but was addressing the location and distribution of the open spaces.  He pointed out that staff was not overly concerned about the location of the open spaces as so much as ensuring a minimum of two acres was dedicated to the development. Mr. Silva confirmed that staff always contemplated the two-acres being distributed separately (one acre lots) and todayï¿½s proposed amendment would clarify this distribution and location. In response to Commissioner Higginsï¿½ request, ACA Kerbel clarified the motion before the Board was to approve the foregoing application per staff recommendation with the additional condition that a revised covenant be submitted prior to any further permitting applications with the revised condition.

Rene Garcia Vote: 9 - 0 Absent: Hardemon , Rodrï¿½guez Excused: Higgins , Cabrera REPORT: Assistant County Attorney (ACA) Eddie Kirtley Jr. announced that the foregoing application was mistakenly deferred with the setting of the agenda.  He explained that the applicant wished to have the matter considered by the Board of County Commissioners (Board); and advised in accordance with recently adopted legislation, a motion to reconsider was appropriate. It was moved by Senator Garcia to reconsider the foregoing application. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Cohen Higgins and upon being put to a vote, passed by a vote of 9-0 (Commissioners Cabrera, Hardemon, Higgins, and Vice Chairman Rodriguez were absent). Mr. Eric Silva, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department, read the title of the foregoing application into the record, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Chairman Gilbert III relinquished the chair to Commissioner Regalado. Commissioner Regalado opened the public hearing; there being no one appearing wishing to speak, the public hearing was closed. Mr. Robert Eber, 9415 Sunset Drive Suite 258, Miami, appeared on behalf of the applicant, Garciaï¿½s Oasis, LLC., and provided a brief overview of the application with the aid of a PowerPoint presentation highlighting the following:: ~ Stateï¿½s Certificate of Good Standing; ~ Property Photos; ~ Site Plan; ~ Compatibility with the Neighborhood; ~ Petitions of Approval; ~ Property Approvals; and ~ Reasons to Approve. In response to Chairman Gilbertï¿½s III request for clarification as to why the application should be approved despite staffï¿½s recommendation to deny, Mr. Eber explained that staffï¿½s recommendation to deny was based on the absence of three (3) or more similarly-sized parcelized properties contiguous to the subject property, as required by the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP).  He noted that staff contends the property located behind the subject property could not be considered as part of the ï¿½parcelizedï¿½ requirement because the neighboring property was used for farmland.  Mr. Eber argued that despite the adjoining property being similar in size and abutting the subject property, the presence of trees made it a different parcel type; and noted that the applicant was willing to also plant fruit trees if required for the approval. Mr. Eber pointed out that in the event the application was approved, the applicant would be the first property owner to comply with the recently adopted legislation requiring an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system once the dwelling was constructed.  He requested the foregoing application be approved since it was consistent with the surrounding parcels, and noted the applicant was in agreement with the condition listed for the pond.  Mr. Eber advised that a site plan was submitted for the pond and there were not issues with the setback requirements. Mr. Silva confirmed that staffï¿½s recommendation to deny was based solely on the absence of three (3) or more similarly-sized (five (5) acre) parcelized properties contiguous to the subject property, as required by the Comprehensive Development Master Plan (CDMP). Commissioner Regalado pointed out that the County could not require a property-owner to commit to agricultural uses for a property.   She thanked the applicant for their willingness to plant more trees, but noted that would not be enough to deem the property ï¿½agriculturalï¿½ according to the CDMP Plan. Responding to Commissioner Regaladoï¿½s inquiry as to whether the denial recommendation was primarily made so that the land would be preserved for agricultural uses or to maintain the aesthetics of the neighborhood; Mr. Silva stated that staffï¿½s intent was to avoid the creation of small lots that could interfere with agricultural production. Commissioner Regalado called for the property ownerï¿½s rights to be recognized and honored, and recommended the Board address the three (3) sided parcelized property CDMP policy to ensure the rule was consistent with the intent of the Countyï¿½s CDMP. She recommended the applicant consider participating in the Green Belt program and spoke about the benefits. Chairman Gilbert III reasoned that designating the subject property for ï¿½agriculturalï¿½ use would disrupt the neighborhoodï¿½s flow.  He pointed out that there were other homes in the vicinity and indicated his support for approving the application. Commissioner Bermudez concurred with the comments made by Chairman Gilbert III and Commissioner Regalado, and requested clarification regarding the presence of a dwelling on the property abutting the subject property. Following staffï¿½s confirmation that the neighboring parcel contained a house, Commissioner Bermudez opined that the foregoing application should be approved. Senator Garcia concurred with his colleagues and indicated his support for the foregoing application.  He stated that while he recognized staffï¿½s intent to follow the CDMP policy, he believed the foregoing application provided the Board an opportunity to revisit the CDMP policy and modify the requirements to serve the community better. Commissioner Bastien indicated her support for approving the application. Responding to Commissioner Cohen Higginsï¿½ inquiry as to whether there was a dwelling currently situated on the subject property, Mr. Eber clarified that there were work sheds located on-site. Commissioner Cohen Higgins thanked her colleagues for their input, and referenced her previous comments about reviewing CDMP and Zoning policies to make the process easier for homeowners. She acknowledged that there were similar houses surrounding the subject property, and moved to approve the application inconsistent with staffï¿½s recommendation, along with the approval of requests 2 and 3 related to the existing pond and setback provisions. There being no other comments or objections, the Board approved the foregoing application. 3C 240257 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2023000129  --  DISTRICT(S): 09 --  APPLICANT: IGLESIA CRISITANA EL BUEN SAMARITANO, INC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT SEEKS TO PERMIT A PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FOR 1,500 STUDENTS IN GRADES K-12.

Commissioner Higgins commented the focus of her interest was on how the project design would accommodate all Uber/Lyft valet parking, on-demand transit services, and parking for the developmentï¿½s residents. Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; and after hearing no one from the public wishing to speak, he closed the public hearing. Mr. Silva announced a covenant was included in the report; but recently, the applicant submitted a revised covenant to change the amount of the transit contribution from $450,000 to $1.5 million. He stated that the Board members would receive a new covenant today. Ms. Melissa Tapanes, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin Tapanes PLLC, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, spoke on behalf of the applicant in support of the application. She presented a PowerPoint presentation explaining the general proposed development plan for the property located at 888 Brickell Avenue. She noted the proposed application increased the public benefit to $1.5 million for the signalization of South Miami Avenue and 10th Street and other transit improvements such as wayfinding technology improvements and pedestrian-friendly amenities subject to the Countyï¿½s discretion regarding the onsite loading of Uber passenger vehicles. She stated that the March 7, 2024, memorandum issued by the Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) indicated that the Miami-Dade County Traffic Engineering Division (TED) of the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) required building an eastbound exclusive left-turn lane at the signalized intersection of SE 10th Street and Brickell Avenue that significantly reduced the existing sidewalk. She pointed out that the applicantï¿½s proposal recommended maintaining the pedestrian realm and the sidewalk at its current size, which allowed the opportunity to preserve the landscaping improvements. Ms. Tapanes explained the proposed general development plan demonstrated a clear mobility plan and would provide 274 elevator-accessible parking spaces. She provided an overview of the proposalï¿½s pedestrian improvements and prioritization. Commissioner Higgins stated she had a dialogue with DTPW and RER regarding their recommendation to reduce the current sidewalk due to the institution of the exclusive left-turn lane. She asked the County Attorney and Mr. Silva to withdraw TEDï¿½s engineering condition relating to the left-turn lane to ensure the original size of the sidewalks remained the same size before holding the applicationï¿½s Administrative Site Plan Review (ASPR). She pointed out that she preferred the applicantï¿½s original proposal as it related to the sidewalks. Commissioner Higgins stated the pedestrian mobilization and micro-mobility improvement conditions listed in a memorandum dated October 25, 2022, issued by the Infrastructure Planning Division of DTPW, were missing from the applicationï¿½s conditions. She noted that the subject memorandum was missing from this application package and asked if those same conditions needed to be included in this application. Mr. Silva responded that information would be included in the report. He noted the last page of the application package after the signature page listed all departmental memorandums with language saying the project was subject to all conditions contained in the memoranda. Commissioner Higgins stated that, in the future, she would not allow the approval of a zoning application if the issuance date of a memorandum from the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) was over six months old. She stated departments should update any memorandums dated over six months before the applicationï¿½s consideration at the zoning hearing; otherwise, she would defer the application. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell advised the motion on the table was to approve the application per the staffï¿½s recommendations and conditions. However, with the modification of conditions in the site plan to not reduce the sidewalk by the referenced left turn lane and have the sidewalk remain at its current size with a 30-day requirement to submit the final executed revised Covenant and Opinion of Title. Hearing no other comments or objections, the Board members proceeded to vote and approved the application per the staffï¿½s recommendations and conditions. The Board subsequently adopted and set forth the resolution in the Record of Resolutions as Zoning Resolution Number Z-36-24. All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s meeting were transferred to the care, custody, and control of the Department of Planning and Zoning. 5/23/2024 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1C 240665 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO:  Z2023000037 --  DISTRICT(S): 08  --  APPLICANT:  296 LEGACY, LLC. --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICANT SEEKS APPROVAL OF A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE ON THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FROM AGRICULTURAL, RU-1, BU-1, AND BU-1A, TO MCD, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE SITE WITH A MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT WITH RETAIL USE AND 751 MULTI-FAMILY UNITS, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

THE APPLICANT ALSO SEEKS TO WAIVE THE REQUIRED 5ï¿½ WIDE CLEAR PATH ALONG THE BUILDING FRONTAGES ON SW 294 STREET.  --  LOCATION: 16401 SW 296 STREET, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Deferred\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto\r\n\t\t\t\t\t July 17, 2024 Zoning Z-40-24 Mover: Danielle Cohen Higgins Seconder: Eileen Higgins Vote: 11 - 0 Absent: McGhee Excused: Garcï¿½a REPORT: Mr. Eric Silva, Assistant Director, Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Department, read the title of the foregoing application into the record, noting the application had seven (7) protests and two (2) waivers filed. Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing, and the following members from the public appeared before the Board in opposition to the application: 1. \tMs. Lucia Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Homestead, Florida 2. \tMr. Ernesto Echauri, 27610 SW 153rd Court, Homestead, Florida 3. \tMr. Efren Nuï¿½ez, 16062 SW 287th Street, Homestead, Florida After hearing no other persons from the public wishing to speak, Vice Chairman Rodriguez closed the public hearing. In response to Vice Chairman Rodriguezï¿½s question regarding the speakersï¿½ statements regarding the lack of notice, Mr. Silva confirmed the legally required notices were mailed to the community. Ms. Maria Gralia, 150 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida, spoke on behalf of the applicant, 296 Legacy, LLC. She also confirmed the legally required notices were sent to the community and signs were posted on the property. She explained the applicantï¿½s outreach efforts to communicate with the community and presented a PowerPoint presentation to give an overview on the details of the proposed development. She noted the applicant had requested zoning changes to a mixed-use corridor district and three (3) variances. She pointed out the proposed development was one hundred percent (100%) affordable housing for thirty (30) years at sixty percent (60%) Average Median Income (AMI) to mitigate any impact on the neighborhood and had a maximum density of 751 multi-family residential units at that price. Commissioner Cohen Higgins questioned the information given in a memorandum dated April 10, 2023, written by the former Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) Chief regarding public safety-related issues, police service requirements to service the subject area, and the rationale for having deferred the application twice. She also questioned the date of the memorandum versus the dates of the application deferrals. Discussion ensued between Commissioner Cohen Higgins and Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell regarding the statement in the memorandum indicating the County had insufficient police officers to provide adequate police services to the subject area. Commissioner Cohen Higgins advised she was unsupportive of the proposed application due to her concerns regarding public safety-related issues and the information outlined in the previously referenced memorandum from the former MDPD Chief. She asked the incumbent MDPD Chief to provide an updated memorandum. Commissioner Cohen Higgins commented on her concerns about the public transportation-related issues pointed out by the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW). She referenced DTPWï¿½s 11 conditions outlined on pages 29 and 30 of the applicantï¿½s application relating to sidewalks, pedestrian, and bicycle accessibility due to the projectï¿½s proximity to the busway and rapid transit. She indicated conditions should be required. Commissioner Cohen Higgins asked for a deferral of the application to allow an opportunity to receive an updated application package for re-evaluation and have concerns addressed. She asked that the applicant coordinate their efforts better with the impacted community. In connection with Vice Chairman Rodriguezï¿½s question, Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer Raurell advised the Boardï¿½s Rules of Procedures relating to the deferral of an agenda item was inapplicable to the zoning hearings. Vice Chairman Rodriguez commented that the applicant needed to address the impacted communityï¿½s concerns better due to the nature of the application. Commissioner Higgins expressed her support for Commission Cohen Higginsï¿½ request to receive an updated memorandum from the incumbent MDPD Chief and to establish departmental conditions as requirements. Commissioner Bermudez recommended holding community meetings in a place located close to the impacted community and establishing conditions as mandates. Commissioner Hardemon concurred with the sentiment to use the appropriate language in applications to require conditions rather than providing guidance, particularly when the zoning law provided a choice. Chairman Gilbert, III, also concurred with the need to include language in the application to mandate conditions. The Board members proceeded to vote to defer the application to July 17, 2024, as requested by Commissioner Cohen Higgins, to have the following concerns addressed: - \tThe public safety-related matters; - \tThe request to provide an updated memorandum to the April 10, 2023, memorandum issued by the former Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) Chief to address the issue mentioned relating to the shortage of police officers to provide police services to the subject area; - \tThe public transportation-related issues pointed out by the Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW); and - \tTo change the language on pages 29 and 30 of the application, Conditions 1 through 11, to change the word ï¿½shallï¿½ to mandate the departmentï¿½s conditions and requirements. All exhibits submitted for the record at todayï¿½s meeting were transferred to the care, custody, and control of the Department of Planning and Zoning. 4/18/2024 Deferred by the Zoning Board 5/23/2024 Deferred by the Zoning Board 1D 240937 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH NO: Z2023000355  --  DISTRICT(S): 05  --  APPLICANT: 128 SW 7TH STREET OWNER, LLC.  --  SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THIS APPLICATION IS REQUESTING A SPECIAL EXCEPTION TO PERMIT APPROVAL OF AN INITIAL REVIEW OF THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR A SUBJECT PROPERTY LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BRICKELL METROMOVER STATION, AND ASSIGN TO IT THE PERMITTED USES AND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE UNDER SECTION 33C-15 OF THE COUNTY CODE FOR THE ï¿½METROMOVER STATION SUBZONEï¿½.  --  LOCATION: 128 SW 7 STREET, CITY OF MIAMI, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA Approved staff recommendation with condition(s) Zoning Z-37-24 Mover: Eileen Higgins Seconder: Roberto J. Gonzalez Vote: 10 - 0 Absent: Gilbert, III , McGhee Excused: Garcï¿½a REPORT: Mr. Eric Silva, Assistant Director, Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Department, read the title of the foregoing application into the record, noting the application had no protests or waivers filed. Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; and after hearing no one from the public wishing to speak, he closed the public hearing. Commissioner Higgins recommended a reduction in the Average Median Income (AMI) limit from 140% to 120% as a maximum to facilitate the recruitment of attorneys for the Offices of the Public Defender and State Attorney due to the incompatibility of entry-level salaries and the high employment turnover caused by high housing costs. She stated that her recommendation intended to assist public sector servants. Commissioner Regalado concurred with Commissioner Higginsï¿½ recommendation to lower the percentage criteria to 120% AMI. She recommended the introduction of a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) mechanism since it would accommodate these populations, provide prioritization, and increase accessibility. She noted the ROFR system would create a holding place to allow those populations to apply first. Commissioner Higgins pointed out that the Public Housing and Community Development (PHCD) Department managed the process and compliance aspects of the last two (2) Metromover Rapid Transit Corridor (RTC) projects providing Workforce housing units. She also pointed out that the processes and management of Workforce housing should remain consistent for all Metromover RTC projects that provide Workforce housing units. Commissioner Regalado further explained the ROFR mechanism benefits that would assist the previously referenced populations and other public employees. A discussion ensued among the Board members regarding the AMI percentage criteria compared to the qualification process. Mr. Javier Aviï¿½o, Bilzin Sumberg Law Offices, 1450 Brickell Avenue, 23rd Floor, Miami, Florida, explained the revised Covenant already included the customary 60% to 140% AMI limitation range associated with Workforce housing. He stated that the applicant was amenable to accepting prioritization, working with PHCD, and offering ROFR. He advised the applicant wished to maintain flexibility to expedite the occupancy of units without precluding the right of others to apply and to make the 140% criteria applicable to subsequent population subgroups of applicants. Discussion ensued among the Board members and Mr. Aviï¿½o regarding the range of the AMI limit criteria, the total number of Workforce housing units available to public sector employees, the number of public service attorneys that would qualify, and how best to provide preference to a particular population subgroup of applicants. In response to Commissioner Gonzalezï¿½s question, Commissioner Higgins explained how the monthly rent amount was determined based on income and the importance of reducing the AMI limitation to 120%. Commissioner Regalado explained that the market rate and the AMI limitation criteria were unequal and differed throughout the 13 county commission districts. Discussion ensued among the Board members and Mr. Aviï¿½o regarding the Uber and Lyft traffic flow management, the sufficiency of traffic lanes, parking availability for deliveries, and valet services. Commissioner Higgins commented on the excellent pedestrian improvement recommendations made by DTPW and the applicant for SW 7th and 8th Streets, which were State-controlled roadways. She noted that FDOT had rejected those recommendations, but she would collaborate with FDOT to ensure the residents residing in those buildings felt safe crossing the streets. Commissioner Bastien concurred with Commissioner Higgins's motion to reduce the AMI limitation to 120%.

Vice Chairman Rodriguez opened the public hearing; and after hearing no one from the public wishing to speak, he closed the public hearing. Mr. Graham Penn, Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin & Tapanes, PLLC, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 300, Miami, Florida, counsel for the applicant, made a PowerPoint presentation to explain the intent of the application and the propertyï¿½s development per staffï¿½s recommendation. He advised that the application requested a density reduction in home sites from its existing density of four (4) home sites to one (1) single-family home and to build a second driveway on the east side of the property to provide access to the garage and guest house. He pointed out that this application would preserve .8 acres of the significant Pine Rockland Habitat, which was not a condition of the Miami-Dade County Code. He noted the applicant volunteered to preserve the land. In response to Vice Chairman Rodriguezï¿½s question, Ms. Justine Velez, Urban Robot Associates, 420 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach, Florida, responded that the applicant chose a pony barn due to their desire to use it for enjoyment with their children and as a petting zoo. Commissioner Cohen Higgins expressed her support for the application. Chairman Gilbert, III, expressed his support for the application. He noted that, even though the County also needed this level of housing, the Board had just deferred an application with 60% Area Median Income (AMI) and pointed out that the County needed more affordable housing developments. Commissioner Hardemon commented that a property owner should be able to develop his property as allowed by law. After a discussion with Commissioner Hardemon, Mr. Penn formerly withdrew the applicantï¿½s request for a setback reduction variance for the detached shade house structure; and the applicant would relocate the detached structure to 20 feet in. Regarding Commissioner Hardemonï¿½s inquiry, Mr. Silva advised that the applicant only had to withdraw the setback reduction request and submit a revised site plan showing the location of the detached shade house. Commissioners Cohen Higgins and Bermudez accepted the applicantï¿½s withdrawal of the setback reduction variance. Upon conclusion of the discussion, the Board members proceeded to vote and approved the foregoing application per the staffï¿½s recommendations to include the withdrawal of the request for a setback reduction variance and resubmitting a revised site plan showing the detached shade house location. The Board subsequently adopted and set forth the resolution in the Record of Resolutions as Zoning Resolution Number Z-38-24.
