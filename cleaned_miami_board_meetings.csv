Mr. Daniel Raffoul, 1800 Sunset Harbor Drive, Apartment 2207, Miami Beach FL, appeared on behalf of his grandfather, the applicant, Mr. Alexander Gamarnik and stated in response to comments made by Commissioner Monestime at the June 20, 2019 Zoning meeting, the applicant had made every effort to clean the area and even installed ï¿½no parkingï¿½ signage and fire lanes throughout the site.  Mr. Raffoul noted the applicant hired staff to continue maintaining the area including the litter left by patrons of the food trucks located along 117th Street and submitted photos of the now clean area into the record as exhibits. Commissioner Monestime acknowledged improvements made to the subject properties as evidenced in the photos submitted by Mr. Raffoul and asked whether approval of the application could be contiguous to the maintenance and upkeep of the lots. Assistant County Attorney Abbie Schwaderer-Raurell pointed out the application sought to amend the North Central Urban Area District (NCUAD) regulating plan to re-designate the subject property from mixed use corridor (MC) to mixed use corridor special (MCS) and suggested directing staff to monitor the property and enforce pursuant to the Countyï¿½s code. Commissioner Monestime requested clarification regarding the proper vehicle to approve the application in light of staffï¿½s recommendation to deny without prejudice. Assistant County Attorney Schwaderer-Raurell stated a motion to approve the application was sufficient along with a separate directive to the administration related to monitoring and enforcing the Countyï¿½s regulations regarding maintenance and upkeep of the subject property. Commissioner Monestime moved to approve the foregoing application and requested staff continue to monitor the subject property and provide enforcement pursuant to the Countyï¿½s code. Hearing no further questions or comments, the Board proceeded to approve the application and the foregoing resolution was adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-18-19.

Moss Seconder: Sally A. Heyman Vote: 13 - 0 REPORT: Mr. Nathan Kogon, Assistant Director, Development Services, Regulatory & Economic Resources (RER) Department read into the record the title of the foregoing application, noting there were no protests or waivers filed. Chairwoman Edmonson opened the public hearing. Mr. Jose Rivero, Zoning Analyst 2, Miami-Dade Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER), announced there was one speaker registered to speak on the foregoing application. Clerk of the Board Director Melissa Adames administered the witnessï¿½ oath to Mr. Jonathan Cruz. Mr. Jonathan Cruz, MDG Designs, 6187 NW 167th Street, Miami FL, appeared on behalf of the applicant Greenlands Realtors, Inc. He noted the application was filed in 2018 and sought variances to construct the building to the rear of the property instead of the front, as required by the Naranja Community Urban District (NCUD).  Mr. Cruz pointed out all of the other businesses in the area was located to the back of the properties and argued changing the design to comply with the NCUD requirements would result in various problems to the business owner.  He advised the Board members that there was an alley running across the plot of land and the front area was too small to accommodate the size of the building needed for the business.  Mr. Cruz stated relocating parking to the rear of the property would result in additional parking and traffic congestion and pointed out the recently constructed Walmart was allowed to keep parking to the front of the plot.  He proceeded to publish a PowerPoint presentation detailing the proposed design and site plans for the project.  Mr. Cruz concluded the presentation by pointing out the Florida Power and Lights (FPL) lines located to the front of the subject site and noted relocating the lines would result in additional costs to the applicant. Mr. George F. Mobassaleh, Property owner and President/Owner of Elegant Beauty Supplies, spoke about his business and explained when he purchased the property all the other business buildings, including the recently constructed Walmart, were situated to the rear of the plots with parking located to the front.  He told the Board members that the project would be cost prohibitive and have to be cancelled if the building could not be built to the rear of the lot and asked the Board to approve the application. There being no one registered to speak, Chairwoman Edmonson closed the public hearing. Responding to Commissioner Mossï¿½ request for an explanation regarding staffï¿½s recommendation, Mr. Kogon reviewed the application and noted the applicant had requested eight variances in total.  He explained staffï¿½s recommendation to deny was based on the fact that the applicantï¿½s proposed site plan was a departure from the Countyï¿½s plan for urban mixed use in urban centers.  Mr. Kogon stated while the plan was not inconsistent with existing structures, staff believed the same type of building structure could be achieved by constructing the building to the front of the lot with parking to the rear. Commissioner Moss inquired about the alley issue and how it could be resolved. Mr. Kogon indicated staff did not see any issue with an alley on the site. In response to Commissioner Mossï¿½ question as to how the applicantï¿½s proposed design would contribute to his vision of creating ï¿½Mini Dadelandsï¿½ along US1 and comply with the Countyï¿½s design plans along major transportation modes, Mr. Kogon stated that staff believed the proposed development was an underutilization of the site since the property was zoned to allow for a development up to fifteen stories and an intensity of up to 125 units per acre. Commissioner Moss moved to deny the item without prejudice, per staff's recommendation. This motion was seconded by Commissioner Heyman and the foregoing resolution was subsequently adopted by the Board and set forth in the Record of Resolutions and assigned #Z-20-20. 11/21/2019 Deferred by the Zoning Board B 200098 Zoning Regulatory and Economic Resources PH: 	Z2019000074  --  DISTRICT(S) 6 -- APPLICANT: DOUBLE DK PROPERTIES, LLC -- SUMMARY OF REQUEST(S): THE APPLICANT IS SEEKING A DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGE FROM RU-1, RU-4A, BU-1A, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE SUBJECT PROPERTY WITH A SELF-STORAGE FACILITY.
